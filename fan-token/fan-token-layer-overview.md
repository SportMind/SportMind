# Fan Token™ Intelligence — SportMind Layer 3

> AI-powered sports intelligence connecting on-chain fan token data, transfer markets,
> athlete social activity, on-pitch performance, off-pitch development, and commercial
> brand strategy into a unified, queryable layer for clubs, agents, athletes, and brands.

**Before loading any Layer 3 skill, read `fan-token/fan-token-why.md`.**
It explains why fan tokens exist as a category, what structural problems they solve
that the traditional sports model cannot, and where the trajectory leads. An agent
or developer who understands the thesis will reason differently about everything
the skills in this layer produce.

## Lifecycle and partnership intelligence — Layer 3 temporal framework

The skills above address the **active state** of a fan token. Two additional skills
address the **temporal dimension** — how a token's intelligence profile changes
across its full lifecycle:

### `fan-token/fan-token-lifecycle`
The complete lifecycle framework. Documents six phases from pre-launch through
post-partnership continuation. The central insight: fan tokens cannot be cancelled —
they are on-chain assets that transition from governance utility to predictive utility
when official partnership infrastructure ends.

Key concepts:
- Six-phase lifecycle model (pre-launch → active utility → plateau → non-contractual)
- Lifecycle-adjusted Layer 3 signal weights (which metrics apply at each phase)
- The non-contractual token principle: post-partnership on-chain persistence
- Prediction market as post-partnership utility form
- CEX/DEX trajectory model for non-contractual tokens
- On-chain holder data as persistent fan sentiment intelligence
- The open primitive model: third-party use cases without club approval

### `fan-token/fan-token-partnership-intelligence`
The partnership relationship framework. Documents new partnership signals,
health monitoring, termination events, and non-contractual token case studies.

Key concepts:
- Partnership quality assessment (due diligence before token launch)
- Partnership Health Score (PHS): five-indicator composite
- Tier 1–5 new partnership signal taxonomy with CHZ impact ranges
- Termination patterns: announced, silent lapse, forced, category exit
- Case studies: Type A (active partnerships under stress: $JUV, $ACM), Type B (uncertain status: $FAZE, ISL tokens), Type C (confirmed non-contractual: smaller club tokens)
- IMPORTANT: $JUV and $ACM are ACTIVE Socios/Chiliz partnerships — used as Type A behavioural case studies only
- The relaunch pathway: non-contractual to re-contractual
- Community empowerment: why non-contractual communities are intelligence assets

### The non-contractual token in prediction markets

A fan token that has lost official partnership utility is not worthless —
it is **utility-decoupled**. It continues to exist on-chain, continues to trade,
and continues to correlate with sporting performance. Prediction markets,
GameFi applications, and third-party developers can build on these tokens
without requiring official club approval. The prediction market form of
utility (price as aggregate sporting sentiment signal) may be more durable
than governance utility because it requires only: (1) the token continues
to trade, and (2) the club continues to play sport. Both outlast any
specific commercial partnership.
