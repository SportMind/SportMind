# Changelog

## [3.73.0] — 2026-04-17

### Changed
- `core/core-narrative-momentum.md` — expanded from 344 to 585 lines. Six new sections:

  Tournament knockout narrative amplification: round multipliers (R16 ×1.20 →
  Final ×2.00 applied to narrative modifier), defending champion +5% per match,
  first-time finalist +4%, compound rule for overlapping Cat7 + knockout context.
  WC2026 CALENDAR_COLLAPSE integration: narrative resets to zero on elimination.

  Post-tournament narrative decay: three-phase model (Phase 1 days 1–7 = do not act
  on residual signal, Phase 2 days 8–21 = 50% modifier, Phase 3 day 22+ = fresh reset).
  Season-end equivalent. Cross-season relegation/return narrative (Category 3 applies).

  Championship decider and season finale narrative: title race final round multipliers
  (×1.15 at 5 matches → ×1.50 at final decider). F1, MotoGP, NASCAR finale frameworks.
  Dead rubber detection: SUPPRESS narrative + DEAD_RUBBER flag.

  Cross-sport narrative dominance: WC active = non-football AELS ×0.85. Olympics =
  all sports elevated (no compression). Super Bowl = US-market token compression ×0.90.
  Trigger: social volume 5× baseline for 3+ days = CROSS_SPORT_COMPRESSION flag.

  Trilogy and multi-bout narrative (combat sports): trilogy = ×1.50 (maximum),
  controversial rematch = ×1.30, long gap ≥2y = ×1.10. Beyond trilogy: fatigue
  applies ×0.80 per additional fight. Age/physical decline cap: ×1.10 max if
  fighter 3+ years past peak.

  Drive to Survive / documentary narrative (DTS effect): DTS = commercial signal
  ONLY (AELS, CDI) — never modifies SMS. Active DTS: ×1.15 AELS + CAUTION flag
  on social volume (may be noise, not sporting signal). bc_dts_effect MCP tool
  returns current DTS status per sport.

- `compressed/README.md` — narrative momentum compressed skill added (77→78 total)

### Fixed
- `docs.html` — two structural HTML bugs causing sections to render outside the
  grid layout. Bug 1: orphan </div> in mcp-server section was closing <main> early,
  pushing 9 sections (usage-modes through output-schema) outside the grid. Bug 2:
  metrics section missing </section> closing tag. All 12 sections now balanced.

## [3.72.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- `fan-token/world-cup-2026-intelligence/world-cup-2026-intelligence.md` — expanded
  from 331 lines to 544 lines. Four new sections:

  PATH_2 interaction with World Cup 2026: what changes (commercial significance,
  CQS 1.35–1.40, NCSI ×3.5–4.0) vs what does not (protocol mechanics identical —
  0.25% pre-liquidation, WIN=burn, LOSS=neutral). Cumulative supply reduction model
  (best/expected/worst case). AGENT RULE: pre-liquidation during WC = PROTOCOL_EVENT.
  Tournament WIN NCSI persistence (60 days post-tournament for winner squad members).
  DOUBLE EVENT WARNING for PATH_2 clubs losing ATM-tier World Cup winners.

  National team token framework: four structural differences from club tokens —
  no domestic competition signals (HAS dormant outside tournaments), no PATH_2
  as of 2026, different CDI decay curve (stage-reached table: group exit=18 days
  through winner=75 days), higher Speculator archetype share. Entry/exit discipline:
  T-14 days to T-2h entry window; 4h either side of elimination = hard no-enter.
  $ARG narrative amplifier ×1.25 (conditional on Messi final WC confirmation).

  CALENDAR_COLLAPSE tournament elimination mechanics: trigger conditions, effects
  by token type (national vs club with/without PATH_2), 5-step signal chain on
  elimination, hard rules. Distinguishes national token HAS decay from club token
  NCSI removal — club tokens continue on domestic cycle, PATH_2 unchanged.

  Post-tournament supply and signal reset: week-by-week reset from July 20,
  NCSI decay table (winner ×1.5 at day 30 → ×1.0 at day 60), Golden Boot/Ball
  persistence to Jan 2027, transfer window intersection (Aug 15–31 peak),
  season supply record close procedure.

### Changed
- `fan-token/world-cup-2026-intelligence/world-cup-2026-intelligence.md` — version
  footer: v3.40 → v3.72. Agent reasoning protocol updated with Path 2 cross-reference.
- `compressed/README.md` — WC2026 compressed skill updated to include all four
  new sections (PATH_2 interaction, national token framework, CALENDAR_COLLAPSE,
  post-tournament reset).
- `docs.html` — toolkit/calibration section order in HTML corrected to match sidebar.

## [3.71.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- `examples/agentic-workflows/web-agent-live-data.md` — Pattern 13 (Web Agent Live Data)
  Three use cases: (A) Autonomous lineup confirmation via wa_lineup_target + Fetch MCP —
  fetches official lineup at T-2h, compares against pre-match expected squad, raises
  ABSENCE_CONFIRMED for missing ATM-tier players, re-runs sportmind_pre_match with
  updated availability. (B) PATH_2 supply verification — fetches Chiliscan post-match,
  computes supply delta, classifies BURN_CONFIRMED / BURN_PENDING / BURN_ANOMALY /
  SUPPLY_NEUTRAL_CONFIRMED, logs to season supply record. (C) Regulatory monitoring —
  scheduled Chiliz/ESMA/SEC fetch, applies external-intelligence-intake.md framework,
  escalates findings with human_required=True. Failure handling and three-pattern
  connection map included.

- `agent-prompts/agent-prompts.md` — Prompts 23 and 24 (22 → 24 total)
  Prompt 23 (Broadcast and commercial intelligence agent): bc_broadcast_value,
  bc_rights_tier, bc_audience_reach, bc_context_quality, bc_dts_effect. Covers
  commercial context not match outcome. CQS/SMS separation rule prominent.
  Prompt 24 (Web agent live data connector): wa_lineup_target + wa_supply_verify +
  wa_macro_monitor + Fetch MCP. Three workflow sequences with timing rules. Source tier
  enforcement and no-auto-update rule explicit in prompt.

- `compressed/README.md` — Two new compressed skills (75 → 77 total)
  Prompt 23 (broadcast/commercial) and Pattern 13 (web agent live data).

### Changed
- All 8 MCP server scripts: VERSION 3.71.0 (were at v3.70.0 or v3.67.0/v3.68.0)
- `examples/agentic-workflows/README.md` — Pattern 13 added to table (12 → 13 patterns)
- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — 575 files, 80 version cycles
- Website — v3.71.0, prompts 22→24, patterns 12→13, compressed 75→77, files 575

## [3.70.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- `core/standings-intelligence.md` — Standings Intelligence Brief (SIB, 352 lines)
  Six season arc phases: Title Race, European Qualification, Relegation Battle,
  Active Relegation, Confirmed Safety, Mid-Table Stability. Trajectory model
  (RISING/STABLE/FALLING/VOLATILE) from last-5 vs season PPG delta. Eight
  proximity threshold flags including TITLE_CLINCH_POSSIBLE (+6 SMS) and
  RELEGATION_ESCAPE_POSSIBLE (+8 SMS). Cross-sport: football, NBA, NHL, NFL,
  MLS. Fan token integration: LTUI trajectory from standings phase, CDI
  adjustment table, holder archetype behaviour by phase. PATH_2 note:
  standings phase does not change burn mechanics but relegation lowers
  season win frequency. Backs the gc_standings MCP tool with a full framework.

### Changed
- `demo.html` — Three new scenarios (15→18 total):
  governance: $PSG kit vote · GSI 72 · 41% participation · Tier 1 vote quality check
    notification sequence (T-72h/24h/4h) · archetype targeting rules
  scouting: Lamine Yamal CVS brief · DQI 84 · ATM 0.85 · system fit 82

  transfer: Gyökeres to Arsenal · TVS 81 · DQI-adjusted valuation gap +€18M
    system fit 74 · RAF 0.81 · $AFC token acquisition signal · WC2026 NCSI

- `docs.html` — Metric Glossary expanded: 10 entries → 34 entries
  All 27 named composite metrics from project instructions now defined:
  core signal (SMS, ARI, LQI, TMAS, PPI, TCM, DQI, MgSI, CQS, TIS, CSS, RAF),
  fan token (FTIS, HAS, TVI, CDI, LTUI, ATM, AELS, NCSI, CHI, MRS, ABS, APS, DSM, GSAx),
  transfer/commercial (DTS, TVS, DLVS, PI, PS, TAI, SHS, AFS). Each definition
  includes formula references, range values, and actionable thresholds.

## [3.69.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added

  ARI (Athlete Readiness Index): formula, five component weights, FAN TOKEN
  FTIS dampener rule, ARI label thresholds (500–600 tokens).
  OTP (Opponent Tendency Intelligence): four domains, sample minimums,
  tendency half-life table, OTP CONFIRMS vs CONTRADICTS signal chain rule.
  CQS (Contextual Signal Environment): formula, six dimensions, canonical
  values (UCL QF=1.27, dead rubber=0.73), DEAD_RUBBER_FLAG, CQS/SMS
  separation rule.
  TIS (Travel and Timezone Intelligence): eastward>westward rule, timezone

  non-negotiable rules — all under 600 tokens.

- `demo.html` — World Cup 2026 scenario (scenario 15)
  Argentina vs Brazil · MetLife Stadium · US primetime · $ARG token · NCSI ×3.5
  Covers: WC2026 structural differences (48-team, US timezone, US market unlock),
  NCSI amplifier progression (group ×3.5 → final ×4.0), CQS 1.38 context,
  CALENDAR_COLLAPSE on elimination, CDI ×1.35 US market amplifier. Plain-English
  brief: why this is the most commercially valuable match in fan token history.

### Changed
- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — 573 files, 78 version cycles
- `scripts/sportmind_mcp.py` — VERSION 3.69.0

## [3.68.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- `platform/web-agent-connectors.md` — Web Agent Connectors (3 connectors, 522 lines)
  Framework for web agent integration at SportMind's three highest-value live data
  points. Connector 1 (Lineup Confirmation): exact fetch targets by sport (football,
  basketball, cricket, MMA, ice hockey), extraction spec, availability translation
  to ARI component inputs, failure modes. Connector 2 (PATH_2 Supply Verification):
  Chiliscan API endpoints, burn confirmation logic, season supply log schema,
  timing rules (T+15m minimum / T+6h definitive), SUPPLY_ANOMALY escalation.
  Connector 3 (Regulatory and Macro Monitoring): ESMA, SEC, CFTC, Chiliz blog,
  Socios — Tier 1/2 classification, library files at risk, classification workflow.
  Extends platform/fetch-mcp-disciplinary.md to cover all three connectors.
  Fragility acknowledgement section: five non-negotiable rules including no
  auto-updates from web agent output and T+15 burn modifier timing rule.

- `scripts/sportmind_wa_mcp.py` — Web Agent MCP Server (port 3008, 3 tools)
  wa_lineup_target: returns exact URL, extraction spec, availability translation,
  and agent rules for lineup confirmation for any supported sport. Includes per-sport
  source tier rankings, timing windows, and absence-detected action rules.
  wa_supply_verify: returns Chiliscan API endpoints, burn verification logic, timing
  rules, and season log schema for PATH_2 token supply confirmation. Context-aware:
  WIN / LOSS / DRAW each generate different verification instructions.
  wa_macro_monitor: returns all regulatory monitoring targets with fetch URLs,
  extraction specs, and classification workflow. Filterable by tier and domain.
  Zero-dependency principle maintained: server returns targets and specs; the web
  agent (Fetch MCP / Claude in Chrome / Playwright) does the actual fetching.

### Changed
- `platform/sportmind-mcp-suite.md` — Web Agent server added: 8 servers total
- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — 570→573 files, 76→77 version cycles
- `README.md` — platform/ count 26→28

## [3.67.0] — 2026-04-15

### Added
- `scripts/sportmind_ft_mcp.py` — Fan Token MCP Server (port 3002, 8 tools)
  Dedicated Chiliz/Socios intelligence: ft_token_state, ft_burn_forecast,
  ft_community_health, ft_fraud_scan, ft_holder_brief, ft_tournament_exit,
  ft_macro_context, ft_registry. Covers FTP PATH_2 mechanics, holder archetypes,
  MRS fraud scan, CALENDAR_COLLAPSE, and full fan token registry (24 tokens).

- `scripts/sportmind_pm_mcp.py` — Pre-Match Signal MCP Server (port 3003, 3 tools)
  Zero-friction entry point: pm_signal (full pre-match package), pm_squad_brief
  (availability + manager language decoder), pm_readiness (simplified ARI gate).
  Lowest barrier to entry in the SportMind ecosystem.

- `scripts/sportmind_bc_mcp.py` — Broadcast & Commercial MCP Server (port 3004, 5 tools)
  Commercial intelligence: bc_broadcast_value (BVS), bc_rights_tier (rights
  valuations per competition and territory), bc_audience_reach (reach tier +
  India Rule), bc_context_quality (full 6-dimension CQS), bc_dts_effect
  (Drive to Survive / content catalyst by sport).

- `scripts/sportmind_gc_mcp.py` — Governance & Competition MCP Server (port 3005, 6 tools)
  Season-arc and governance intelligence: gc_governance_state (GSI score),
  gc_vote_alert (72h/24h/4h notification sequence + quality filter),
  gc_standings (table position + threshold proximity + relegation fear signal),
  gc_competition_state (knockout rules, two-leg aggregate, away goals note),
  gc_fixtures (data connector guidance), gc_calendar (season arc by month).

- `scripts/sportmind_sc_mcp.py` — Scouting & Transfer MCP Server (port 3006, 5 tools)
  Pattern 10 as callable tools: sc_cvs_brief (Composite Value Score + bid range),
  sc_dqi (Decision Quality Index + UNDERVALUED flag), sc_system_fit (PPDA-based
  system compatibility), sc_valuation (DQI-adjusted fair value vs market price),
  sc_transfer_brief (RAF context, window timing, negotiation phases).

- `scripts/sportmind_al_mcp.py` — Agent Lifecycle MCP Server (port 3007, 5 tools)
  Multi-agent orchestration: al_agent_start (register agent with type/goal/
  autonomy level), al_agent_status (cycles, signals, escalations), 
  al_escalation_inbox (retrieve + resolve pending escalations), al_memory_write,
  al_memory_read. Enables A2A coordination pattern.

- `platform/sportmind-mcp-suite.md` — Complete documentation for all seven MCP
  servers. Deployment patterns, tool parameters, Claude Desktop configs,
  and typical use-case combinations per audience.

### Changed
- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — 557→570 files, 76→77 version cycles

## [3.66.1] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- `sportmind.dev/autonomous.html` — favicon missing; added all four favicon links
  matching other pages (svg, 32px png, 16px png, apple-touch-icon).
- `sportmind.dev/agent.html` — favicon missing; same four links added.
- `sportmind.dev/autonomous.html` — run button text unreadable in light mode.
  Button used hardcoded color:#050f07 (near-black) on var(--accent) background.
  In light mode --accent = #16663a (dark forest green) + near-black text = illegible.
  Fixed to color:#ffffff (white) which is readable on both dark green (light mode)
  and bright green (dark mode). Spinner border colours updated to match.

### Changed
- `macro/macro-regulatory-sportfi.md` — ESMA confirmation added: CHZ MiCA whitepaper
  is now officially registered under ESMA's whitepaper register (April 2026).
  This upgrades the status from "planned/in progress" to "confirmed compliant".
- `macro/macro-crypto-market-cycles.md` — CHZ virtuous cycle confirmed OPERATIONAL:
  9.2M CHZ burned in April 2026. DeFi wallet integration on Socios.com noted for
  mid-2026. Previously these were roadmap projections; now operational confirmations.

## [3.66.0] — 2026-04-15

### Added
- `core/athlete-readiness-index.md` — Athlete Readiness Index (ARI: 0.60–1.10)
  Unified pre-match readiness score combining five components: fatigue trajectory
  (schedule/congestion-based), motivation state (bridge from athlete-motivation-
  intelligence), travel and timezone penalty (bridge from travel-timezone-
  intelligence), injury risk accumulation (predictive ACWR-based load threshold
  model, not just binary availability), and availability confidence (lineup source
  reliability weighting). ARI acts as a final readiness gate after the standard
  modifier chain — backward-compatible with all existing patterns. Cross-sport:
  football, basketball, cricket, MMA, rugby, F1, tennis. Fan token: ARI < 0.80
  for ATM-tier players applies direct FTIS dampener (−5 to −10 points). Three
  worked examples included: Saka at full readiness (0.99), Saka as international
  returnee (0.94), NBA star on B2B post-hamstring (0.889).

- `core/opponent-tendency-intelligence.md` — Opponent Tendency Profile (OTP)
  Historical tendency profiling for specific teams, coaches, and athletes.
  Distinct from TMAS (structural system mismatches) — models what a specific
  opponent ACTUALLY DOES in specific game states. Four tendency domains:
  coach in-game decisions (substitution timing, formation shift triggers),
  situational tendencies (leading, trailing, must-win, elimination), set piece
  patterns (corner delivery, free kick zones, penalty direction — with explicit
  privacy rule), athlete micro-tendencies by sport (dribble direction, serve
  pattern, grappling entry). Tendency half-life documented by category: set
  piece routines change every 4–8 weeks; must-win situational profile is
  persistent (character-based). Sample size minimums enforced.

- `core/agent-cognitive-architecture.md` — Agent Cognitive Architecture Map
  Maps SportMind's components to standard AI cognitive architecture taxonomy
  (Russell & Norvig): Reactive, Model-Based Reflex, Goal-Based, Utility-Based,
  Learning, Multi-Agent Systems, and BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention). For each:
  what it is, how SportMind implements it, which specific files provide the
  capability, and honest capability ratings. Establishes SportMind's primary
  architecture as Model-Based Reflex (the skill library as world model) and
  Utility-Based (ENTER/WAIT/ABSTAIN as terminal utility function). Honest
  about limitations: learning is library-level not agent-level; agent-level
  learning is intentionally constrained for auditability reasons.

- `platform/wearable-biometric-connectors.md` — Wearable Data Integration
  Five connector categories: GPS/load tracking (Catapult, STATSports, Kinexon),
  recovery monitoring (Whoop, Oura, Garmin, Polar), biomechanics/force
  (Catapult Vector, Zebra, force plates), physiological monitoring (Zephyr,
  Polar Team Pro), and match tracking (Hawkeye, StatsBomb 360, Opta Vision).
  For each: available metrics, translation formula to ARI component inputs,
  and agent decision rules. Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR > 1.50 =
  injury risk elevated) integrated with ARI injury_risk_threshold component.
  CMJ decline > 15% = PHYSICAL_FATIGUE_CONFIRMED flag. Zero-dependency
  principle maintained: connector translates third-party outputs, not raw data.

- `platform/fan-engagement-connector.md` — Fan Engagement Action Bridge
  Translates SportMind holder archetype intelligence into concrete engagement
  actions across four channels: push notification triggers (by archetype ×
  event type × timing window), content targeting matrix (what each archetype
  responds to and when), CRM integration (segment-based retention and churn
  signals), and governance alert timing (72h/24h/4h notification sequence,
  governance topic quality filter). Critical PATH_2 timing rule enforced:
  Speculator notifications must wait T+15 post-WIN for AMM rebalancing.
  Loyalist loss notifications minimum 60 min delay. Includes non-fan-token
  application: archetype model applies to any sports digital community product.

### Changed
- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — 552→557 files, 75→76 version cycles, platform 24→26
- `README.md` — 53→56 core frameworks

## [3.65.3] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — version cycles corrected from 66 to 75 (true v3.x release count).
  GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md — stale file count 465→552, leaderboard v3.27→v3.65 reference.
  Both files: calibration records temporarily changed 126→127 then reverted after
  discovering the 127th JSON file is a calibration report (calibration-report-v3.6.json),
  not an outcome record. True count confirmed: 126 outcome records, 5 wrong-direction,
  121/126 = 96.0% accuracy.

### Changed
- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — version cycles: 66→75 (v3.0 through v3.65.2 = 75 v3.x releases).
- `GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md` — file count 465→552, leaderboard version v3.27→v3.65.

## [3.65.2] — 2026-04-14

### Changed
- `FIRST-RECORD-CHALLENGE.md` — removed email submission option (calibration@sportmind.dev).
  GitHub Issue is now Option A (recommended, no technical knowledge required).
  GitHub PR is Option B. Review window changed from "7 days" to "automated checks
  run immediately, human review within 30 days". Email route removed because it
  creates private manual workload without adding capability over the Issue path.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — review timelines updated: skill PRs reviewed within 30 days
  (was 7 days / 14 days). Calibration records note added: automated validation,
  most merge within 48 hours. Community modifier review now explicitly triggers
  at 5+ active community calibrators rather than being a v4.0 roadmap item.
  Automation note added to calibration section explaining what the GitHub Action
  validates automatically vs what requires human judgment.

## [3.65.2] — 2026-04-14

### Changed
- `FIRST-RECORD-CHALLENGE.md` — Option B (email to calibration@sportmind.dev)
  removed. Replaced with GitHub Issue path: open issue, paste record, maintainer
  creates the PR. Review window changed from "merge within 7 days" to async —
  records merge when they pass the validity check; 30-day soft backstop.
- `community/calibration-data/CONTRIBUTING.md` — same email removal and
  async review window applied. Modifier recalibration vote window changed from
  "7-day, minimum 5 responses" to "open window, closes at consensus or 30 days
  inactivity, minimum 3 responses from contributors with validated records".
- `core/calibration-framework.md` — community vote window updated to match.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — skill PR review changed to async; no fixed window;
  30-day soft backstop for unanswered PRs.

## [3.65.1] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- `sportmind.dev/autonomous.html` — beta badge invisible in light mode
  Used hardcoded rgba(255,255,255,0.3) for text colour — white at 30% opacity,
  invisible against light backgrounds. Fixed to var(--text-3) / var(--bg-3) /
  var(--border) CSS variables matching all other pages.
- `sportmind.dev/docs.html` — stale "11 agentic workflow patterns" in examples/
  table row. Updated to 12. Heading was already correct; table row was not.
- `sportmind.dev/docs.html` — core/ layer description did not mention
  contextual-signal-environment.md or travel-timezone-intelligence.md
  added in v3.65.0. Description updated.
- `sportmind.dev/index.html` — Layer 3 (fan token) listed as "40 skills" and
  "Path 1/2". Updated to "61 skills" and "PATH_2 confirmed" to reflect current
  library state.

## [3.65.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- `core/contextual-signal-environment.md` — Contextual Signal Environment (CSE)
  Unified framework treating day of week, kickoff time, venue capacity/occupancy,
  broadcast audience reach, schedule density, season position, and territory
  timezone window as a combined Context Quality Score (CQS: 0.60–1.40) that
  amplifies or dampens FTIS and CDI calculations. Six scored dimensions with
  worked examples: UCL QF prime time (CQS 1.27) vs League Cup tie (CQS 0.94)
  vs dead rubber (CQS 0.73). Critical distinction enforced: CQS modifies
  commercial signal magnitude (FTIS/CDI/HAS), NOT the on-pitch SMS.
  FTP PATH_2 note: burn mechanics are fixed per result; CQS determines how
  many holders are watching and amplifying that burn commercially.
  Schedule slot scoring: Wednesday 8pm UCL prime (1.35), Saturday evening (1.30),
  IPL Indian primetime (1.35). Venue weight: capacity tiers with occupancy bands.
  Audience reach: Global Tier 1 (300M+, 1.40) to niche/emerging (0.70).
  Season position: title decider (1.40), dead rubber (0.70), relegation fear
  noted as generating HIGHER engagement than comfortable mid-table.
  Territory window: European evening + Americas afternoon overlap premium (+0.10).

- `core/travel-timezone-intelligence.md` — Travel and Timezone Intelligence
  Travel Impact Score (TIS: 0.80–1.00) applied to athlete modifier chain.
  Eastward travel penalised more heavily than westward (circadian asymmetry).
  Three penalty components: timezone crossing (1–3 zones: −0.01, 7+: −0.10–0.15),
  haul duration (<3h: −0.01, 11+h: −0.06), recovery adjustment (< 24h arrival:
  full penalty; 7+ days: penalty → 0). Sport-specific patterns: UCL European
  away legs (TIS 0.97–1.00), international break returnees from Americas/Asia
  (TIS 0.90–0.93), Lions tours first provincial matches (TIS 0.90–0.92),
  NBA cross-country B2B early slot (TIS 0.90). F1 driver adaptation bonus (50%
  of standard penalty for experienced grid). Data source guidance: travel
  confirmed via press conference, club social media, Tier 1 journalists.

### Changed
- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — 550→552 files, 65→66 version cycles, v3.64→v3.65
- `README.md` — 51→53 core frameworks

## [3.64.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- `fan-token/tournament-elimination-intelligence.md` — Tournament Elimination
  Intelligence for FTP PATH_2 clubs. CALENDAR_COLLAPSE framework: when a team
  is eliminated, all future WIN burn events in that competition are cancelled —
  agents must reason about the structural season impact, not just the match loss.
  Three elimination scenarios by round (group stage, knockout, final). Quantifies
  projected PATH_2 burns lost, NCSI events cancelled, and LTUI trajectory revision.
  Arsenal vs Sporting UCL QF Leg 2 (aggregate 1-0) canonical worked example with
  all three aggregate outcome paths. Two-legged tie classification rules — away
  goals rule correctly noted as removed from UEFA competitions in 2021. Output
  schema with token signal including plain English summary.

### Fixed
- `sportmind.dev/autonomous.html` — nav bar stuck in dark mode regardless of theme
  Root cause: nav background used hardcoded rgba(10,14,11,.95) instead of
  var(--bg). Light mode CSS variables were correctly defined but the nav
  rule bypassed them. Fixed to var(--bg) — nav now responds to light/dark/system
  theme toggle matching all other pages.

### Changed
- `core/sports-trend-intelligence.md` — Women's sports commercial maturity added
  as Trend 8b: $2.4B revenue projected 2025 (50% CAGR since 2022), viewership
  tripled since 2020, first women's league fan token = ×1.50 CDI modifier.
  Sources: Houlihan Lokey Fall 2025, Apollo Sports Capital December 2025.
- `sportmind.dev/autonomous.html` — full light/dark/system theme support added.
  Theme toggle button added to nav. Page no longer permanently dark — responds to
  system preference and user toggle matching all other website pages.
- `sportmind.dev` (all five pages) — SportMind "beta" badge added to nav logo
  on every page to signal to visitors that the project is still in active development.

## [3.63.1] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- `sportmind.dev/autonomous.html` — complete rebuild fixing all interaction bugs
  Root cause 1: Scenario click handlers and run button used per-element
  addEventListener calls that failed silently on Netlify hosted pages.
  Replaced with event delegation on container element.
  Root cause 2: API call to api.anthropic.com is blocked by CORS on any
  hosted static page — the platform built-in API only exists inside the
  Claude.ai artifact sandbox environment, not on sportmind.dev. Replaced
  with pre-scripted authentic SportMind reasoning chains: zero API
  dependency, zero cost, zero API key required. All six scenarios now
  execute correctly with animated pipeline phases, live signal cards, and
  agent status panel. IBM Plex Mono/Sans aesthetic preserved.

### Added
- `sportmind.dev/agent.html` — hero section added above the provider interface
  Title, subtitle, and description explain what the page does, how it
  differs from the autonomous demo, and which providers are supported.
  Cross-link to /autonomous for zero-key alternative. Four feature pills:
  6 providers, 6 presets, full conversation, your API key your costs.
- `sportmind.dev/demo.html` — Autonomous nav link added.

### Changed
- All five website files — nav link audit and consistency corrections.

## [3.63.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- `core/external-intelligence-intake.md` — External Intelligence Intake Framework
  Three-tier classification system for incoming articles, papers, and media.
  Tier 1 (act immediately): regulatory guidance, confirmed token launches, PATH
  changes, academic papers with empirical findings — update library files same session.
  Tier 2 (queue for trend review): market analysis, trend confirmations, ecosystem
  updates — inform next version release.
  Tier 3 (monitor, no action): opinion pieces, retail guides, unconfirmed rumours.
  Trusted source registry by tier (Tier A: SEC.gov, Blog.chiliz.com, official bodies;
  Tier B: CoinDesk news, The Athletic, Sky Sports confirmed; Tier C: retail guides).
  Decision rules mapping article types to specific library files.
  Five-step intake workflow: classify → extract facts → impact assessment → human
  confirmation → implement or queue. Zero automatic library changes.
  sportmind_ingest_article MCP tool specification (fetch URL → classify → identify
  impacted files → return structured intake brief — advisory only).
  Standing intelligence feeds: weekly (Chiliz blog, KAYEN, macro BTC check),
  monthly (CoinDesk fan token coverage, academic pre-prints), event-specific
  (World Cup 2026 daily monitoring June–July 2026).

### Changed
- `macro/macro-regulatory-sportfi.md` — US market intelligence update
  April 2026 confirmation from CoinDesk (April 10) added: DC Blockchain Summit
  March 17 guidance confirmed, US market status = OPEN.
  First-mover signal framework added: first franchise per US league to launch
  = ×1.40 CDI modifier at launch (first-mover premium). League sequencing:
  NBA most likely first (digital-native fan base), NHL second, NFL third, MLB fourth.

## [3.62.1] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- `core/star-departure-intelligence.md` — broken internal link:
  `core/athlete-disciplinary-intel.md` → `core/athlete-disciplinary-intelligence.md`
- `platform/sequential-thinking-integration.md` — self-referencing broken link:
  `core/sequential-thinking-integration.md` → `platform/sequential-thinking-integration.md`
- `MCP-SERVER.md` — stale version references v3.34/v3.35 updated to v3.62
- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — second reference to agentic workflow patterns (10→12) and
  agent prompts (20→22) corrected. Both references now consistent.

## [3.62.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- `fan-token/fan-holder-profile-intelligence.md` — Fan Holder Profile Intelligence
  Four holder archetypes: Loyalist (long-term, identity-driven, low crypto-sophistication),
  Speculator (price-driven, high TVI, short hold), Governor (governance-motivated,
  high vote participation), Amplifier (social-status driven, KOL-correlated).
  Detection via on-chain patterns: wallet age, TVI ratio, governance participation,
  social correlation. Community Health Index (CHI): loyalist_share×0.35 +
  governance_participation×0.25 + retention×0.25 + organic_volume×0.15.
  CHI 75+ = healthy; <40 = fragile (LTUI at risk). Churn Risk Score (CRS):
  price_underperformance, governance_quality_decline, membership_devaluation,
  community_fracture — the last directly from Ante et al. (2025) German football
  expert interviews. Personalisation triggers by archetype. FTP PATH_2 connection:
  Loyalist-majority community compounds long-term scarcity value from burn cycles.

- `platform/fraud-signal-intelligence.md` — Fraud Signal Intelligence
  Six attack types: wash trading, coordinated wallet accumulation (Sybil-adjacent),
  pre-event pump and dump, undisclosed paid KOL promotion, governance capture,
  MEV/sandwich liquidity pool manipulation. Manipulation Risk Score (MRS 0–100):
  TRUST (<25), CAUTION (25–49), SUSPECT (50–74, downgrade to WAIT), COMPROMISED
  (75+, ABSTAIN). Python detection class with per-attack scoring. FTP PATH_2 rule:
  do not apply WIN burn modifier at full weight if MRS ≥ 50. MRS decay rule:
  SUSPECT → CAUTION after 7 days clean; COMPROMISED requires manual review.

- `core/tactical-matchup-intelligence.md` — Tactical Matchup Intelligence
  Tactical Matchup Advantage Score (TMAS: -15 to +15, applied directly to SMS).
  Four dimensions: systemic mismatch (-6 to +6, system pairing advantages),
  personnel exploitation (-5 to +5, physical/pace mismatches), set piece
  differential (-3 to +3), transition asymmetry (-3 to +3). Football, basketball,
  hockey, rugby all covered. Worked example: Arsenal vs PSG UCL — TMAS +7 with
  Saka, +5 without. Connects to Pattern 10 CVS system fit assessment.

- `examples/agentic-workflows/live-match-agent.md` — Pattern 12: Live Match Agent
  Pre-match prior + live event updates = adaptive signal. Event modifier framework:
  goal (+5/+10 or -8), red card (±12, provisional ×0.82 during VAR review), key
  injury (-8 to -2 by ATM tier), half-time reload, VAR reversal handling.
  LiveMatchAgent Python class with process_event() and get_current_signal().
  FTP live rules: do not adjust PATH_2 intra-match; wait T+15 post-WIN for
  algorithmic rebalancing before applying burn modifier. Free/paid live data
  sources documented. Fraud check at full-time rule.

### Changed
- `core/core-officiating-intelligence.md` — VAR/technology-assisted officiating
  Full section added: VAR league coverage (UCL/EPL/etc.), provisional modifier
  ×0.70 during VAR review, penalty overturn rate ~15%, automated offside (SAOT),
  goal-line technology. Rugby TMO: ×0.82 provisional, 12–18% overturn rate.
  Tennis Hawk-Eye and cricket DRS. Emerging AI judging in MMA noted.

- `fan-token/defi-liquidity-intelligence/defi-liquidity-intelligence.md`
  Section 10 added: algorithmic market feedback from burn events. T+0 to T+15
  = AMM rebalancing + arbitrage bots (NOT organic demand). T+15+ = genuine signal.
  Liquidity depth effect: TVL <$100k reduces WIN modifier weight 30%.
  Burn signal classification: genuine / algorithmic / manipulated.

- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — 544→548 files, 62→63 version cycles, v3.61→v3.62
- `README.md` — 48→50 core frameworks
- `platform/sportmind-mcp-server.md` — v3.61→v3.62

## [3.61.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- `core/perceptual-pressure-intelligence.md` — Pressure Performance Index
  PPI (0–100) → modifier 0.88–1.18. Four components: Clutch Record (35%) —
  sport-specific clutch stats (penalty conversion, tiebreak win rate, final
  frame record, NBA clutch +/-); High-Stakes History (30%) — Tier A/B/C
  performance vs career average, small sample caveat and redistribution rule;
  Experience Depth (20%) — cognitive benefit of high-pressure exposure,
  debut effect as variance inflator not directional modifier, pressure scar
  flag for 3+ Tier A failures; Recovery Rate (15%) — bounce-back pattern
  after negative in-match events, most useful for live analysis. Sport baselines:
  football (FBref clutch data), tennis (tiebreak differential), snooker
  (Crucible record), darts (Ally Pally record), MMA (championship round rate),
  F1 (qualifying variance). FTP connection: PPI_premium on CVS scouting score
  (±7.5 points); win probability uplift for high-PPI starting XI in UCL/major finals.

- `core/game-tempo-intelligence.md` — Tempo Context Modifier (TCM: 0.90–1.12)
  Three dimensions: pace (possessions/speed), rhythm (system consistency),
  momentum (directional flow). Basketball: pace bands, mismatch signal,
  half-court rhythm disruption, playoff tempo discount (−30% on pace modifiers).
  Cricket: session rhythm (morning ×0.94 batting, evening reverse swing ×1.04),
  T20 death bowling specialist signal, partnership momentum reset window.
  Football: pressing tempo second-half decay (×0.96 after 70 min for high-press
  teams), transition speed mismatch. Ice hockey: line matching home ice
  amplification, shift tempo and fatigue. Tennis: serve+1 vs rally tempo by
  surface, break-back momentum pattern. Anti-stacking rule: TCM + spatial
  modifier combined cap at ×1.10.

- `core/athlete-decision-intelligence.md` — Decision Quality Index (DQI: 0–100)
  → modifier 0.90–1.15. Four components: Chance Creation Quality (30%) — xA/90
  vs position average (FBref); Possession Decision (25%) — pressured pass
  completion%, progressive action rate; Shot Selection (25%) — xG/shot, TS%
  for basketball; Defensive Anticipation (20%) — interception rate vs reactive
  tackle ratio. LQI integration: DQI_modifier multiplies base player rating
  contribution. Pattern 10 connection: DECISION_QUALITY_UNDERVALUED flag when
  DQI > 75 but market value below position average — adds 8–12 points to CVS.
  System fit: high-DQI player in high-decision-demand system (positional play,
  pick-and-roll) = amplified value. Cross-sport: football/basketball/hockey/
  cricket/tennis; not applicable to athletics, swimming, individual timed events.

### Changed
- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — 541→544 files, 61→62 version cycles, v3.60→v3.61
- `README.md` — 45→48 core frameworks
- `platform/sportmind-mcp-server.md` — v3.60→v3.61
- `compressed/README.md` — three new compressed entries: PPI, TCM, DQI
- `core/pre-match-squad-intelligence.md` — added refs to PPI/TCM/DQI
- `examples/agentic-workflows/scouting-agent.md` — added DQI/PPI refs

## [3.60.0] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- `sportmind.dev/agent.html` — complete rebuild fixing provider switching
  Root cause: `const I` (theme icon variable) was declared AFTER the
  `switchProvider('anthropic')` init call in the same script block.
  JavaScript `const` is not hoisted — the redeclaration caused a
  SyntaxError that silently killed everything below it in the script,
  including tab click handlers. OpenAI and Gemini tabs appeared to do
  nothing because their event listeners never ran. Fix: THEME code moved
  to a self-contained IIFE that runs immediately; all app code moved into
  a single `DOMContentLoaded` listener that fires after the DOM is ready
  and all refs are safely available.

### Added (agent.html)
- Groq provider — api.groq.com/openai (OpenAI-compatible). Models:
  Llama 3.3 70B, Llama 3.1 8B, Mixtral 8x7B, Gemma 2 9B. Fast inference,
  free tier available.
- Mistral provider — api.mistral.ai/v1. Models: Mistral Large, Small, 7B.
- Custom endpoint — any OpenAI-compatible API (LM Studio, Ollama, Together
  AI, Fireworks, Anyscale). Developer supplies endpoint URL and model name.
  Covers any provider not listed explicitly.
- Tab click now uses event delegation on the container (not forEach) —
  more robust across all browsers.

## [3.59.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- `core/transfer-negotiation-intelligence.md` — transfer negotiation framework
  Four negotiation types: player contract renewal (6 phases from talks open to
  departure confirmed, with LTUI modifier at each phase), incoming transfer
  (6 phases from rumour to announcement including fee-agreed collapse at 10%
  of deals), outgoing transfer (sell-vs-push signal, auction premium, sell-to-
  rival discount), commercial partner negotiations (sponsor phases, CDI event
  at announcement, commercial tier upgrade signal). Relocation Adjustment Factor
  (RAF) formula: (lifestyle_disruption + league_gap) × age_factor — Middle East
  move at prime age = 0.28 Year 1 modifier, Year 2 partial recovery, Year 3+ full.
  Cross-sport: NBA free agency, cricket IPL/BBL short-format exception, F1 driver
  market, MMA camp disruption. Negotiation failure signals: medical failure as
  chronic injury reveal, fee collapse disappointment window, regulatory failure.
  Connects to: core/star-departure-intelligence.md, core/squad-cohesion-intelligence.md,
  core/athlete-motivation-intelligence.md, fan-token/transfer-signal/.

- `core/match-condition-snapshot.md` — condition fingerprint schema
  Extends calibration record format with a condition_snapshot block capturing
  the full modifier state at prediction time: macro phase and modifier, competition
  tier and event type, squad state (LQI, cohesion SCI, manager MgSI), motivation
  context (active MI drivers), spatial context (formation, pressing system),
  environmental context (weather, congestion, crowd), fan token state (lifecycle
  phase, FTP path, LTUI trajectory), active trend phases, negotiation context.
  Condition Similarity Score (CSS) formula: weighted across 7 components,
  returns 0.0–1.0, no external database required — arithmetic loop over stored
  JSON records. CSS ≥ 0.80 = strong match with confidence uplift (+3 SMS) or
  caution (−5 SMS if SportMind was wrong). LOW_PRECEDENT flag when no record
  above 0.40. Minimum viable snapshot (6 fields) for backward compatibility.
  World Cup 2026 connection: every WC match is a snapshot capture opportunity —
  the 2026 dataset will directly inform 2030 agents. Connects to: community/
  calibration-data/, platform/memory-integration.md, Pattern 11 post-match agent.

### Fixed
- `sportmind.dev/agent.html` — three provider switching bugs
  keyNote DOM: replaced brittle childNodes[0].textContent manipulation with
  full innerHTML replacement — switching to OpenAI or Gemini now correctly
  updates the note text and link. keyLink reference: removed detached node
  updates that silently failed after innerHTML replace. Gemini SSE parser:
  handle array-wrapped chunk format in addition to direct object format.
  Unified error message extraction across all three providers.

### Changed
- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — 539→541 files, 60→61 version cycles, v3.58→v3.59
- `README.md` — 43→45 core frameworks (both references)
- `platform/sportmind-mcp-server.md` — version v3.58→v3.59
- `sportmind.dev/index.html` — Skill files stat corrected: 536→541
- `sportmind.dev/docs.html` — Total files 536→541, Markdown 335→340,
  core/ 40→46, examples/ 33→39. Five stale counts corrected post-release.
  Root cause: `examples/` layer was not in automated drift monitoring;
  `core/` accumulated across v3.57–v3.59 without per-release check.
  Fixed by adding both to the website quality check and known-drift table.

## [3.58.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- `sportmind.dev/agent.html` — SportMind Agent Prototype
  Browser-based live agent powered by Claude Sonnet via the Anthropic API.
  Zero setup — developers bring their own API key (stored in memory only,
  never transmitted to any server except Anthropic directly). Six preset
  scenarios with one-click triggers: PSG vs Arsenal UCL pre-match (full
  five-layer analysis), Mumbai vs CSK IPL evening T20 (dew factor, India
  rule), UFC title fight weight cut signals (weigh-in as primary event),
  Arsenal $AFC FTP PATH_2 cycle (pre-liquidation, WIN burn, LOSS neutral),
  F1 qualifying delta (Monaco, wet weather), star departure AELS void
  (Saka to Real Madrid, supply mechanics). Custom query input for any
  sports intelligence question. Full conversation history with follow-up
  questions. Streaming output with live cursor. Token counter per session.
  System prompt embeds 9 compressed SportMind skills (~900 tokens of
  domain context). Six-step reasoning chain enforced. ENTER/WAIT/ABSTAIN
  output enforced. Agent boundary enforced ("SportMind does not execute
  trades, submit governance votes, or make financial commitments").
  Dark/light mode matching existing site. Nav link added to all three
  existing pages.

## [3.57.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- `core/athlete-motivation-intelligence.md` — unified motivation framework
  Five driver categories: contract/financial (contract year ×1.12, release
  clause proximity, wage dispute), career milestones (career record ×1.18,
  seasonal ×1.12, club ×1.06, post-milestone dip ×0.97), competitive context
  (elimination ×1.12, relegation battle, title decider, ranking pressure,
  home crowd), personal narrative (revenge, farewell ×1.20, return from injury,
  personal difficulty — uncertainty flag not direction), career stage (5 stages
  as amplifier: emerging ×1.15 on drivers → veteran ×0.70 on contract drivers,
  ×1.30 on legacy). Motivation Index (MI) 0.70–1.30 mapping to modifier
  0.88–1.18. Anti-stacking rule: never apply multiple desperation modifiers.
  Output schema with plain_english field. Connects to: core/core-narrative-momentum.md,
  core/athlete-financial-intelligence.md, core/squad-cohesion-intelligence.md.

- `core/squad-cohesion-intelligence.md` — squad cohesion intelligence
  Squad Cohesion Index (SCI): manager alignment (×0.30) + leadership quality
  (×0.25) + recent disruption inverse (×0.25) + cultural continuity (×0.20).
  SCI 80–100 = ×1.10; SCI 0–19 = ×0.88. Tier 1/2/3 signal classification
  with noise rules. Five cohesion scenarios with modifiers: new manager phases,
  post-transfer-window disruption, DSM events, leadership vacuum, bad run.
  Fan token connections: LTUI stability, FTP PATH_2 win probability (SCI 80+
  = ×1.02 uplift; SCI <40 = ×0.95 reduction), social engagement quality
  classification. Cross-sport: football, NBA, cricket (Test), rugby.

- `core/spatial-game-intelligence.md` — spatial game intelligence
  Football: pressing system modifiers (PPDA-based), low block/high line
  implications, set piece aerial dominance framework. Basketball: floor spacing
  and LQI connection (absent shooter → interior star LQI ×0.88), paint
  dominance, transition pace. Ice hockey: zone entry strategy, line matching
  home ice amplification, power play spatial signal. Rugby: territorial control,
  gain line, set piece platform. Scouting connection: SPATIAL_SYSTEM_FIT
  modifier for Pattern 10 CVS calculation (HIGH FIT ×1.08, LOW FIT ×0.88).
  Output schema with matchup modifiers and LQI spatial adjustments.

### Changed
- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — 536→539 files, 59→60 version cycles, v3.56→v3.57
- `README.md` — 40→43 core frameworks (both lines)
- `platform/sportmind-mcp-server.md` — version v3.56→v3.57

## [3.56.0] — 2026-04-12

### Changed
- `sportmind.dev/index.html` — seven improvements
  Stats bar: 532→536 (correct file count), "Agent prompts" replaced with
  "Benchmark scenarios (40)" — more credibility-building and not a count
  already visible in the toolkit section.
  Section reorder: How It Works now appears before Library — it provides
  the transmission-layer framing that makes the library make sense.
  Developer Toolkit: expanded from a text count to three concrete code
  card examples — Pattern 10 CVS/FAS formula, Prompt 21 fan-facing output,
  Pattern 8 FTP monitor pre-liquidation → WIN burn cycle. Counts alone do
  not convert a skeptical developer.
  Use-case cards: five cards added before Contribute — pre-match agent,
  fan token intelligence, transfer/scouting, agentic pipeline, sports
  research. Each links to the relevant demo scenario.

- `sportmind.dev/docs.html` — five improvements
  Stats table: total files 532→536, markdown 331→335.
  Supporting layers: core/ 39→40, platform/ 22→23, arch diagram updated.
  Duplicate "22 agent prompts" block removed from Developer Toolkit section.
  In-page search added to sidebar: live filtering of all 12 sections,
  match highlighting, clear button.
  Output Schema added to sidebar nav (section existed, link was missing).

- `sportmind.dev/demo.html` — three improvements
  Scenarios grouped into four categories: Pre-match (5), Fan tokens (3),
  Agentic (2), Intelligence (4). 14 scenarios total.
  Fan Token Play scenario added: PATH_2 pre-liquidation (PROTOCOL_EVENT),
  WIN permanent burn, LOSS supply-neutral, plain-English brief. The most
  commercially distinctive feature finally has a demo.
  Intro note added below demo description — explains SMS score, ENTER/
  WAIT/ABSTAIN, and output schema reference for first-time visitors.

## [3.55.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- `core/star-departure-intelligence.md` — star departure intelligence framework
  Five departure types (cross-league, rival transfer, retirement, career decline,
  disciplinary removal) each with commercial void timeline, recovery window, fan
  token initial impact range, and LTUI impact. AELS void model: four steps —
  identify AELS contribution, compute share of squad total, determine void
  magnitude (minor/significant/major/catastrophic), plot three-phase recovery
  curve (void T+0–3m, transition T+3–12m, new equilibrium T+12m+). LTUI reset
  triggers: ATM ≥ 0.60, APS ≥ 0.70, AELS void > 25%, commercial partnership
  specifically featuring the player. FTP PATH_2 impact: LQI delta → win
  probability adjustment → season wins lost → supply reduction lost (each
  departure win lost ≈ 0.24% supply reduction per season). Formula:
  win_prob_adjustment = LQI_delta × 0.15. Social signal classification:
  tribute arc (first 72h positive), void searching (weeks 3–8 neutral),
  structural decline (3+ months elevated = distress). Replacement commercial
  quality timeline: upgrade/equivalent/sporting-upgrade-commercial-downgrade/
  no-replacement with months-to-recovery. Cross-sport: football, NBA, cricket,
  F1, rugby, MMA. Full output schema with composite_signal, source_token_modifier,
  plain_english field, and reentry trigger.

### Changed
- `core/core-result-impact-matrices.md` — football departure rows added
  Six new rows: star player departure Type 1 (-10–25%), Type 2 rival (-15–30%),
  retirement (-8–20%), signing commercial upgrade (+8–22%), ATM void period
  (-5–15% ongoing), replacement ATM confirmed (+6–14% recovery).

## [3.54.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- `core/sports-trend-intelligence.md` — trend intelligence framework
  Three trend categories: sport-level commercial trajectory (rising/
  maturing/declining), ecosystem trends (Chiliz/RWA/fan token shifts),
  competitive structure trends (new leagues, player migration, format changes).
  Four phase model: emergence (×0.50 modifier) → acceleration (×1.00) →
  maturation (×0.30) → reversal/plateau (remove). Active trends inventory:
  8 active trends across Tier A (high impact) and Tier B (moderate), plus
  Tier C watch list. Current Tier A trends: women's football commercial
  ascent (Phase 2), Saudi Pro League player migration (Phase 2), Fan Token
  Play Path 2 expansion (Phase 1), MiCA regulatory clarity (Phase 2).
  Trend detection signals: broadcast deals, governing body digital
  announcements, viewership trajectory, marquee player migration, Chiliz
  announcements, regulatory developments. Trend output schema with
  composite_trend_modifier, trend_context_for_brief, and watch_list.
  GFR opponent quality weighting: how globalfootballrankings.com Elo
  ratings modify H2H win weight in historical-intelligence-framework.md.
  Equivalent rating sources by sport (clubelo, FIFA, ATP/WTA, UFC, NBA SRS,
  ICC). Integration with Patterns 1/2/11 and Prompts 21/22.

- `core/verifiable-sources-by-sport.md` — football section expanded
  New "Team and league strength" subsection: GFR (globalfootballrankings.com),
  Club Elo (clubelo.com), FIFA World Rankings — each with use case and
  connection to historical-intelligence-framework.md.

### Changed
- `sportmind.dev/demo.html` — trend intelligence scenario (12th scenario)
  Saudi Pro League T-02 trend assessment: Phase 2 acceleration confirmed,
  why_trending block (PIF investment, 8 top-50 players), all three layer
  impacts (L4 market tier ×1.25, L2 APS ×0.85, L1 fixture weight ×1.15),
  GFR Elo growth data (+21 points in 3 seasons), watch list.

## [3.53.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- `platform/api-connector-examples.md` — five working connectors
  Connector 4: MMA/UFC via API-MMA (RapidAPI) — fight card quality,
  LQI fight_quality score, replacement flag detection, finishing rate.
  Connector 5: Cricket via CricketData.org — squad/toss, dew risk
  assessment (lat/lon + time → HIGH/MODERATE/LOW), format detection.
  Connector 6: NBA injury report parser — Q/D/O/GTD → SportMind
  availability modifiers, team-level modifier calculation, GTD check timing.
  Connector 7: NHL morning skate via NHL API (unofficial) — goaltender
  identification, GSAx-to-LQI conversion, back-to-back detection.
  Connector 8: Odds divergence detector via The Odds API — Pinnacle-first
  sharp market selection, overround removal, STRUCTURAL_EDGE/CONFIRMING/
  MARKET_CONTRADICTS/NEUTRAL classification, SMS-to-implied-probability
  mapping. Full wiring example: all five connectors + SportMind MCP in
  one production pre-match chain.

- `platform/api-providers.md` — five section expansions
  MMA: API-MMA (RapidAPI), Tapology, Sherdog — fight camp duration,
  weight cut history, finishing rate, style classification endpoints.
  Cricket: CricketData.org endpoints, Cricbuzz RapidAPI wrapper with
  actual paths, Sportmonks batter/bowler H2H endpoint, Statsguru guide.

  Odds and prediction markets: The Odds API — free tier 500 req/month,
  sport keys, response structure, overround removal formula, when to use
  in SportMind agent chain vs when to ignore.
  Rate limit table: 7 new APIs added.

### Changed
- `sportmind.dev/demo.html` — odds divergence scenario (11th scenario)
  SportMind SMS 78 vs Pinnacle market for Arsenal vs Bournemouth.
  Shows STRUCTURAL_EDGE classification, overround removal, probability gap
  calculation, and interpretation guide (confirming/edge/contradicts).

## [3.52.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- `sportmind.dev/index.html` — Agentic intelligence stack diagram + section
  "How it works" section added between Developer Toolkit and Signal Output.
  Five-row visual flow: data sources → SportMind intelligence layers (green)
  → agent patterns → structured output → human decision point (dashed).
  Engine/transmission framing: "AI agents are powerful. Without structured
  sports intelligence they produce generic output. SportMind is the transmission
  layer." Pure CSS, no external libraries. Matches existing design tokens.
  Toolkit bridge updated: 22 prompts and 11 patterns (was stale at 20/8).

- `sportmind.dev/docs.html` — Full architecture diagram in Architecture section
  Six-band diagram: data sources → intelligence layers (highlighted in accent)
  with supporting layer sub-nodes → agent patterns → output types → human
  decision point (dashed) → application layer. Inline note: "SportMind agents
  produce intelligence — they do not execute transactions, submit votes, or
  negotiate contracts. The human decision point is architectural."

- `sportmind.dev/demo.html` — agent_stack_trace scenario (10th scenario)
  Full pipeline trace: all five phases shown (macro gate → squad intelligence
  with LQI → historical H2H context → domain + athlete modifier → FTP
  commercial). Pre-match signal: adjusted_score 42.4, SMS 61, MEDIUM confidence,
  lineup flag active. Post-match: UNEXPECTED_LOSS, FTP NEUTRAL, calibration flag.
  Transmission model output block showing agent boundary explicitly.

## [3.51.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- `core/lineup-quality-index.md` — bottom-up team strength model
  Aggregates individual player ratings into a Lineup Quality Index (LQI)
  for any confirmed or projected starting lineup. Formula: LQI = Σ(rating ×
  positional_weight × availability_factor) / baseline_XI_score. Positional
  weight tables for football (11 players, GK weight 1.8), basketball (5
  starters with star premium), rugby union (15 players, fly-half weight 1.5),
  cricket (batting order + bowling weights, format-adjusted), ice hockey
  (GK weight 2.0, GSAx-based), MMA fight card (main event 0.60 weighting).
  Worked example: Arsenal vs Bournemouth — actual lineup (Saka absent,
  Gyokeres unexpected, Jesus long-term out) scores LQI 0.919 vs baseline
  1.00. Matchup score for home/away comparison. LQI_SIGNAL_CONFLICT flag
  when LQI contradicts primary direction. Data sources (Sofascore Tier 1,
  TransferMarkt proxy, FIFA/EA FC for baseline). Season baseline maintenance
  schema. Full pipeline integration: LQI feeds composite_squad_modifier.

- `core/historical-intelligence-framework.md` — H2H decay and probability
  H2H relevance formula: base_weight × recency_factor × personnel_continuity
  × context_factor. Recency factor: 1.00 (< 6 months) to 0.20 (36+ months).
  Personnel continuity: 1.00 (same manager + 7 starters) to 0.10 (newly
  promoted). Weighted H2H modifier: ×0.92 to ×1.08. Seven sport-specific
  H2H rules: football (manager tactics decay fastest; derby psychological
  multiplier), tennis (surface-conditional H2H; psychological dominance
  patterns), cricket (batter vs bowler H2H; India-Pakistan special case),
  MMA/boxing (style matchup vs H2H distinction; rematch modifier), F1
  (circuit performance index; Monaco special case), NBA (playoff series
  momentum; regular season low weight). Form-based probability conversion:
  SMS → probability range (SMS 80-100 → 65-75%; ranges not point estimates).
  Draw probability framework. Tournament bracket prediction with compounding
  uncertainty model. Combined output schema connecting H2H + LQI.

## [3.50.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- `core/pre-match-squad-intelligence.md` — squad intelligence assembly layer
  The missing assembly layer connecting all squad, injury, press conference,
  disciplinary, and social signals into one coherent pre-match brief.
  Seven-step workflow: confirmed absences → doubtful (press conf) → fitness
  curve adjustment → physical load → replacement quality delta → social signal
  → assemble brief. Multi-sport manager language decoder: football (11 phrases
  with probability ranges), NBA (Q/D/O/GTD system), NHL (morning skate protocol),
  cricket (rest vs injury distinction), MMA/boxing (fight week language), rugby
  (citing risk), tennis (retirement risk modifier). Squad brief output schema
  with technical JSON and plain_english_summary. Sport priority table: when squad
  intelligence matters most per sport. Full integration map to Patterns 2, 9, 10,
  11 and Prompts 21, 22. Data source connections across all 7 sports covered.
  Applies to all team and individual sports with squads, rosters, or fight cards.

- `agent-prompts/agent-prompts.md` — Prompt 22: Pre-match build-up agent
  Full pre-match build-up brief covering squad, team news, manager signals,
  opponent context, social signal, and commercial implications. 8-section
  structure: context → home squad → away squad → what manager said → social
  signal → key matchup → token implications → one thing to check. Sport-specific
  squad notes for football, NBA, NHL, cricket, MMA/boxing, rugby, tennis.
  Explicit distinction from sportmind_pre_match (direction signal) — this prompt
  is squad and context only. Loads 11-file skill stack in defined order.
  22 prompts total.

- `sportmind.dev/demo.html` — pre_match_buildup scenario added
  Full squad status brief for Arsenal vs Bournemouth: confirmed absences
  (Jesus ACL, Partey suspension), doubtful (Saka 50/50 with manager phrase
  decoded), available_impaired (Rice return curve ×0.90), suspension_proximity
  (Gabriel on 4 yellows), manager signals (Arteta decoded as cautious), social
  signal (elevated Saka concern), composite squad modifier 0.84. 9 scenarios total.

### Changed
- `examples/agentic-workflows/README.md` — Prompt 22 reference added to Pattern 2

## [3.49.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- `examples/agentic-workflows/post-match-agent.md` — Pattern 11
  Full post-match intelligence cycle connecting all five layers after a result.
  Three time windows: T+0 (confirmation), T+2h (commercial signal), T+24h
  (consolidation). Classifies result as EXPECTED_WIN, UNEXPECTED_WIN,
  UNEXPECTED_LOSS, or DRAW. Connects macro → sporting result → athlete
  performance → fan token commercial → FTP settlement → social signal →
  plain-English brief → Memory MCP update. FTP Path 2 loss = supply neutral
  (correctly modelled — no dilution). Calibration flag on unexpected results.
  Real example: Arsenal 1-2 Bournemouth (11 April 2026) worked through in full.
  Python implementation with classify_result(), get_signal_recommendation(),
  run_post_match(). Connection map showing all 10 other patterns.

- `agent-prompts/agent-prompts.md` — Prompt 21: Fan-facing pre-match brief
  Translates SportMind five-layer intelligence into plain English for fan token
  holders — no technical knowledge required. Five-section structure: The Match,
  Key Signal, What to Check Before Kickoff, What it Means for the Token, One
  Thing to Watch. Fan Token Play note included when active. Explicit tone guide:
  conversational, honest about uncertainty, no jargon without explanation, no
  financial advice. Example brief included using Arsenal vs Bournemouth context.
  21 prompts total.

- `examples/agentic-workflows/README.md` — Pattern 11 added to table

### Changed
- `sportmind.dev/demo.html` — two new scenarios added
  post-match scenario: Arsenal 1-2 Bournemouth (11 Apr 2026). Real result,
  unexpected loss classification, FTP Path 2 supply-neutral modelling, all
  layers connected, plain-English brief output, calibration flag active.
  social scenario: manager press conference signal. Media intelligence tier
  classification, X API social volume, LunarCrush Galaxy Score, injury flag
  detection, plain-English interpretation. 8 scenarios total.

## [3.48.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- `examples/agentic-workflows/governance-delegate-agent.md` — Pattern 9
  Pre-vote commercial intelligence brief for fan token governance proposals.
  Three vote categories: player signing (APS/AELS/ABS/DTS/LTUI), commercial
  partnership (PHS/AFS/LTUI), operational/cosmetic (GSI Decision_Weight).
  Structured governance brief output schema. Python implementation with
  classify_proposal(), analyse_player_signing(), analyse_commercial_partnership().
  Memory MCP schema for governance state and vote history. Critical principle:
  agent produces intelligence only — vote execution belongs to application layer.
  fetch_active_proposals() stub for developer implementation (Socios API,
  on-chain query, or manual feed).

- `examples/agentic-workflows/scouting-agent.md` — Pattern 10
  Transfer target commercial ranking by value-to-fee ratio. Five-tier
  commercial scouting stack: on-pitch foundation (PI), career trajectory
  (DTS/TAI), social presence (AELS/SHS), transfer-specific (APS/TVS),
  token ecosystem impact (LTUI/ABS). Commercial value-to-fee formula:
  CVS = APS×0.30 + AELS×0.25 + DTS×0.20 + PI_pct×0.15 + LTUI_norm×0.10
  then FAS = CVS / log10(fee_m + 1). Four tiers: EXCELLENT/GOOD/MODERATE/POOR.
  Ranked scout report output schema. Clear distinction from Pattern 6
  (monitors existing athletes; this evaluates candidates).

- `examples/agentic-workflows/README.md` — Pattern 9 and 10 added to table

### Changed
- `sportmind.dev/demo.html` — signal card visualization added
  Pre-match and sentiment scenarios now render a visual signal card after
  typing animation completes. Pre-match card: direction badge (HOME/AWAY/DRAW),
  animated SportMind Score gauge, animated adjusted score gauge, modifier
  breakdown grid. Sentiment card: five-axis bars (macro/fan/social/commercial/
  disciplinary), Fan Token Play supply mechanics block when token is confirmed
  gamified. All gauges animate on completion via CSS transitions. Card resets
  on scenario change. No external chart library — pure CSS/JS.

## [3.47.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- `community/benchmark/` — SportMind vs vanilla LLM benchmark framework
  README.md: methodology, test set structure, scenario selection criteria,
  bias prevention rules, contribution guidelines.
  40 scenarios across 8 sports:
    football (12): UCL Final 2023, PSG vs Arsenal UCL QF 2026, relegation
    six-pointer, El Clásico, last-minute GK change (counter-intuitive),
    Championship Play-Off Final, WC2026 Final, FA Cup squad rotation,
    Bundesliga draw equilibrium, Premier League six-pointer, WC2026 USA
    group draw, PSG fan token governance signal.
    cricket (8): IPL dew factor 2023, India-Pakistan T20 WC multiplier,
    no-dew day game (counter-intuitive), T20 WC Final three-layer, PSL
    Final home ground offset, IPL evening dew 2027, WC2026 QF no-dew,
    IPL opener chasing dew.
    mma (6): Pereira vs Adesanya UFC281, weight miss signal, reign length
    counter-intuitive, Ngannou return injury flag, womens title grappler
    vs striker, short-notice replacement.
    formula1 (6): British GP qualifying delta, wet race Spa specialist
    override, Bahrain GP medium circuit, Austrian Sprint format modifier,
    Monaco qualifying maximum signal, Abu Dhabi championship pressure
    asymmetry.
    basketball (3): KD trade debut signal, NBA Finals Game 7, EuroLeague
    Final Four neutral venue.
    ice-hockey (2): morning skate counter-intuitive, Stanley Cup GSAx.
    tennis (2): Wimbledon grass/age interaction, US Open hard court.
    rugby-union (1): Six Nations Twickenham fortress.
  scripts/run_benchmark.py: async runner, both configs, per-sport filter,
  rate-limit safe, saves to results/latest.json and history archive.
  scripts/score_results.py: accuracy table by sport/difficulty/signal type,
  key variable identification rate, markdown report generator.
  Scenario design principles: domain-specific (dew factor, weight miss,
  qualifying delta), counter-intuitive (morning skate, no-dew day game,
  reign length), fan token commercial, multi-layer signals.

## [3.46.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- `platform/skill-discovery-protocol.md` — dynamic context-aware skill selection
  Replaces static bundle loading for agents handling variable query contexts.
  Context signal taxonomy: 15 boolean/tiered signals across sport, token mechanics,
  calendar, athlete, macro, and market dimensions. Relevance scoring model: base
  scores by skill type + context signal bonuses + exclusion penalties. Token budget
  negotiation algorithm across four tiers (full/standard/constrained/minimal).
  Full Python implementation (SkillDiscovery class, DiscoveryContext dataclass,
  DiscoveredStack output). Integration with sequential reasoning chain.
  When-to-use guide: discovery vs static bundles. Connection to v4.0 verifiable
  ML roadmap — context-tagged discovery runs are training data for a learned skill
  selector. Solves: $AFC in August 2026 with Fan Token Play + transfer window active
  loads 4+ skills that ftier1-football bundle misses entirely.

- `core/multi-agent-context-sharing.md` — shared signal state between concurrent agents
  Three failure modes addressed: signal contradiction (stale macro divergence),
  redundant computation (two agents running identical analysis), context blindness
  (DSM flag visible to one agent but not another). Signal authority model: Tier 1
  global (macro, CHZ burn), Tier 2 per-token (pre-match signal, DSM flags, FTP status,
  lifecycle phase), Tier 3 local (reasoning trace, session history). Five coordination
  rules: macro read-before-analysis, signal ownership check, DSM flag propagation,
  Fan Token Play event propagation, conflict resolution. SharedContextManager Python
  class with Memory MCP backing store. DSM flag propagation immediately invalidates
  any pending ENTER signal across all agents.

### Notes
- Skill discovery addresses the core scale problem: library grows to 481 files but
  get_skill_files() still takes only sport + use_case as inputs. Discovery adds
  13 context signals that dynamically adjust relevance scores and loading priority.
- Multi-agent context sharing is prerequisite infrastructure for any deployment
  with 2+ concurrent SportMind agents — portfolio monitor + pre-match agent is
  the most common combination and previously had no coordination protocol.
- Both documents connect to the verifiable ML roadmap: skill discovery runs
  produce context-tagged calibration data; shared context produces consistent
  signal attribution needed for training data quality.

## [3.45.1] — 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- `scripts/sportmind_mcp.py` — VERSION constant updated 3.34.0 → 3.45.0
  (had been frozen at the version when the MCP server was first built)
- `demo.html` — all scenario sportmind_version strings updated to 3.45.0
  (three scenarios still showed 3.39.0, three showed 3.43.0)
- `docs.html` — sportmind_version string in output example updated to 3.45.0
- `README.md` — fan token skills 36→40, agent prompts 16→20, calibration
  stats 100/95%/19 sports → 126/96%/21 sports
- `WHO-WE-ARE.md` — eight stale figures corrected: version heading v3.34→v3.45,
  file count 465→481, version cycles 34→49, Layer 3 36+→40, core files 28→35,
  platform files 17→21, MCP tools 5→10, i18n files 23→24, outcomes 110→126,
  end-matter future roadmap updated to reflect completed work
- `docs.html` — Layer 3 count corrected 57→40; Fan Token Play named explicitly
  in Layer 3 description (was "gamified tokenomics" only)
- `platform/sportmind-mcp-server.md` — version reference v3.34 → v3.45
- `GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md` — broken reference to non-existent
  scripts/validate_calibration_record.py replaced with correct path
  community/calibration-data/CONTRIBUTING.md

## [3.45.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- `examples/agentic-workflows/fan-token-play-monitor.md` — Pattern 8
  Full four-phase Fan Token Play match cycle workflow (T-48h → kickoff → T+48h).
  Pre-liquidation detection, post-match settlement polling, season supply update.
  Memory MCP schema for Fan Token Play state. Pattern 1 (Portfolio Monitor)
  integration guidance. Working Python implementation for $AFC PATH_2.

- `agent-prompts/agent-prompts.md` — Prompt 20: Fan Token Play monitoring agent
  Specialised system prompt for PATH_2 tokens. Four-phase cycle, classification rules
  (pre-liquidation ≠ distribution signal, LOSS = supply neutral), gamified modifier
  application, CHZ echo signal note, Memory MCP update protocol. 20 prompts total.

### Changed
- `platform/chiliz-chain-address-intelligence.md` — FanTokenPlayMonitor class added
  Three methods: check_pre_liquidation() (T-48h treasury sell detection, 72h window),
  check_post_match_settlement() (burn-to-zero for WIN, treasury mint for LOSS),
  get_season_supply_position() (net burned/minted from season-start transfers).
  identify_treasury_wallet() guidance. Prevents Category 1 distribution_signal error.
  Usage example for $AFC. Makes Category 7 (on-chain-event-intelligence) actionable.

- `scripts/sportmind_mcp.py` — sportmind_sentiment_snapshot updated
  supply_mechanics block added to snapshot output: surfaces fan_token_play_path,
  confirmed_date, pre_liquidation_check instruction, PATH_2 loss note, CHZ echo note.
  Tokens without confirmed FTP return NOT_CONFIRMED with KAYEN check guidance.

- `platform/data-connector-templates.md` — KAYEN connector gamified field
  get_token_data() now reads and returns gamified flag, fan_token_play_path,
  and gamified_note from KAYEN API response. Closes the gap between the documented
  "check for gamified: true" instruction and the actual connector code.

- `examples/agentic-workflows/README.md` — Pattern 8 added to table

### Notes
- All five items make Fan Token Play intelligence actionable for developers:
  FanTokenPlayMonitor makes Category 7 buildable, not just documented.
  Sentiment snapshot surfaces FTP status without a separate lookup.
  KAYEN connector fix means developers get gamified field automatically.
  Pattern 8 shows the full match cycle timing developers need to implement.
  Prompt 20 gives developers a ready-made system prompt for PATH_2 agents.
- $AFC treasury wallet address must be confirmed via chiliscan.com before
  FanTokenPlayMonitor can operate — documented clearly in all three locations.

## [3.44.0] — 2026-04-10

### Changed
- `fan-token/gamified-tokenomics-intelligence/gamified-tokenomics-intelligence.md` — full rewrite
  Path 1 and Path 2 documented as distinct mechanisms with separate signal architectures.
  Path 1: post-match oracle trigger, goal difference scaling (×1.00→×1.60), three safeguards
  (75% net reduction floor, credit burns, 12.5% vesting cap), fallback fee model documented.
  Path 2: four-phase timeline (T-48h pre-liquidation, kickoff bet, T+48h WIN burn or LOSS
  re-mint). Path 2 LOSS = supply-neutral (pre-liquidated amount restored only, not expanded).
  CHZ virtuous cycle connection documented — WIN events generate both fan token burn AND
  CHZ ecosystem burn. $AFC confirmed Path 2 as of 07 April 2026 (first public trial).
  Output schema extended with fan_token_play_path, pre_liquidation_detected, chz_macro_note.

- `macro/macro-crypto-market-cycles.md` — CHZ virtuous cycle section added
  Vision 2030 deflationary mechanism: 10% of fan token marketplace proceeds → CHZ buyback
  → permanent burn (zero address). Fan Token Play amplification: PATH 2 WIN events generate
  additional CHZ burn beyond the base 10% rule. Structural floor signal: quarterly CHZ burn
  rate tiers (LOW <5M / MODERATE 5-20M / HIGH 20-50M / VERY HIGH >50M CHZ per quarter).
  Agent rule: two-layer CHZ analysis (BTC/200d MA + structural floor signal).
  Structural floor modifier: +0.03 to +0.05 on macro_modifier when burn rate MODERATE+.
  Important separation: CHZ burn ≠ fan token burn — different assets, connected economics.

- `fan-token/on-chain-event-intelligence/on-chain-event-intelligence.md` — Category 7 added
  Fan Token Play Events: three detectable on-chain signatures per match for Path 2 tokens.
  Pre-liquidation (T-48h treasury sell ~0.25% supply): confirmation signal, NOT distribution.
  Post-win buyback and burn (to 0x0000...0000): FAN_TOKEN_PLAY_WIN_CONFIRMED.
  Post-loss re-mint to treasury: FAN_TOKEN_PLAY_LOSS_CONFIRMED (supply neutral).
  Agent error prevention: pre-liquidation must never trigger Category 1 distribution_signal.
  CHZ echo signal: WIN confirms both fan token burn AND CHZ ecosystem burn.

- `scripts/sportmind_mcp.py` — $AFC registry entry updated
  fan_token_play: "PATH_2", ftp_confirmed_date: "2026-04-07", ftp_note added.
  Registry field structure documented: fan_token_play, ftp_confirmed_date, ftp_note.
  tool_fan_token_lookup now returns fan_token_play object when fields are present.

- `compressed/README.md` — gamified tokenomics compressed skill updated
  Path 1 and Path 2 architectures. Pre-liquidation detection rules.
  Agent error prevention (pre-liquidation ≠ whale signal).
  CHZ virtuous cycle reference. $AFC confirmed Path 2 noted.

### Notes
- The CHZ virtuous cycle section makes explicit what was implicit in the Vision 2030 docs:
  fan token ecosystem growth is a LEADING INDICATOR for CHZ scarcity and macro modifier
  improvement. This is structurally different from the BTC correlation signal.
- Path 2 LOSS being supply-neutral (not supply-expanding) is the most counterintuitive
  finding from the source material — it means Path 2 tokens accumulate permanent
  deflationary pressure on wins without symmetric inflationary pressure on losses.
- $AFC is the only confirmed Fan Token Play token as of this version. All others require
  KAYEN API confirmation before gamified framework is applied.
- Sources: chiliz.com/chz-burn-report-march-april-2026 and
  fantokens.com/newsroom/chiliz-introduces-gamified-fan-token-play-burn-on-loss-mint-on-win

## [3.43.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- `core/post-match-signal-framework.md` — structured post-match agent workflow
  Time windows: T+0-2h (confirmation only), T+2-24h (commercial signal), T+24h
  (CDI confirmation), T+72h (decay assessment). Result-type commercial modifiers
  for expected/unexpected win/loss/draw. Post-match NCSI calculation workflow.
  Post-match calibration record generation protocol. Ten-step agent sequence.

- `core/prediction-market-intelligence.md` — prediction market as signal input
  Divergence analysis framework: <10% alignment, 10-20% investigate, >20%
  high-conviction or missing info, >30% direction contradiction. Pool depth
  quality tiers (>$500k institutional through <$5k negligible). Azuro
  primary integration, Betfair as football sharp market reference. Gamified
  tokenomics interaction: prediction market odds ≠ fan token commercial signal.

- `platform/verifiable-ml-roadmap.md` — ZK-verified inference future trajectory
  What verifiable ML means for SportMind trust model. Technical path: trained
  model → EZKL ZK framework → Chiliz Chain signal registry. Critical dependency:
  500+ calibration records (current: 126). Timeline: v4.0 target 2027.
  Why community calibration records are training data for the future model.

- `compressed/README.md` — nine new compressed skills added (v3.41-v3.43 platform
  and core capabilities): sequential thinking, memory, fetch MCP, address
  intelligence, social connector, API providers, World Cup 2026, transfer
  window, media intelligence. Plus three new additions: post-match framework,
  prediction market intelligence, verifiable ML roadmap.
  Total compressed skills: 66

### Notes
- Post-match framework fills the largest workflow gap in SportMind: all skills
  were pre-match focused; post-match is when fan token movements are most
  predictable and most measurable
- Prediction market intelligence is explicitly framed as confirming/contradicting
  pre-match signal — NOT as a replacement for fan token commercial signal framework
- Verifiable ML is a planning document: v4.0 target, conditional on calibration
  records. Every community record submitted under v3.x is training data for v4.x.
- Compressed skills now cover all major v3.30-v3.43 capabilities — agents running
  portfolio monitoring can load all 66 compressed skills in ~14,000 tokens vs
  200,000+ tokens for the full library

## [3.42.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- `platform/social-intelligence-connector.md` — LunarCrush connector section added
  - LunarCrushConnector Python class with four methods:
    get_token_galaxy_score() — Galaxy Score, AltRank, sentiment, social volume
    get_token_influencers() — top influencers with KOL tier estimate
    get_topic_social_score() — social health for sports without fan tokens
    get_athlete_social_profile() — cross-platform athlete social metrics for AELS
    get_portfolio_social_snapshot() — ranked Galaxy Score across multiple tokens
  - Fan token slug mapping for all available registry tokens
  - Galaxy Score → HAS signal → commercial modifier table
  - AltRank direction signal (rising vs falling mindshare)
  - Non-fan-token sport use cases (MMA, F1, golf, esports, boxing)
  - Connector selection guide: LunarCrush vs X API decision matrix

### Changed
- `core/data-sources.md` — social intelligence section updated
  LunarCrush added as PRIMARY for fan token social intelligence
  Galaxy Score, AltRank, influencer data, topic scores, athlete profiles documented
  Closes the gap: 8 sport domain files already reference LunarCrush as a signal
  source — now there is a formal data source entry and working connector

### Notes
- LunarCrush complements X API connector — not a replacement
  X API: real-time narrative, journalist monitoring, breaking news
  LunarCrush: composite scores, cross-platform aggregation, influencer IDs
- Free tier available at lunarcrush.com — sufficient for development
- Fan token slugs must be verified at lunarcrush.com/coins before production use
  (slugs can change when LunarCrush updates their asset database)
- Galaxy Score modifier is applied AFTER macro and DSM — social is an amplifier,
  never a gate, never overrides ABSTAIN

## [3.41.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- `QUICKSTART.md` — repo root entry point, under 50 lines
  Three commands to a running signal. Copy-paste setup for MCP server
  and templates. "What you will see" output example. Navigation table
  to every next step. Designed to be read in 60 seconds.

- `templates/fan-token-monitor.py` — single fan token monitor template
  Copy, set TOKEN + SPORT + KEY_PLAYERS, run. Five-phase pipeline:
  macro gate → token registry → sentiment snapshot → disciplinary check
  → final recommendation. All 24 registry tickers documented in config.
  Clean terminal output with contract address and verification links.

- `templates/portfolio-monitor.py` — multi-token portfolio review template
  Copy, edit PORTFOLIO list, run. One macro check for all tokens, then
  sentiment snapshot per token. Ranked output: ENTER / WAIT / ABSTAIN.
  Efficiency rule: full chain only for ENTER candidates.

- `templates/pre-match-signal.py` — one-shot pre-match signal template
  Copy, set SPORT + HOME_TEAM + AWAY_TEAM + COMPETITION + KICKOFF, run.
  Full five-phase chain. Optional token lookup. Reasoning sequence output.
  No configuration beyond match details required.

### Changed
- `WHO-USES-THIS.md` — decision tree added at top
  30-second decision tree routes new developers to the right file in
  one read. Templates referenced throughout. Quick reference card updated.
  Five-minute quickstart updated to use MCP server + templates workflow.

### Notes
- Templates are intentionally distinct from examples/starter-pack/:
  examples = learn from; templates = copy and deploy
- All three templates work with the MCP server at localhost:3001
- Configuration is always at the top of each file, clearly marked
- No new dependencies beyond what starter-pack already requires

## [3.40.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- `fan-token/world-cup-2026-intelligence/world-cup-2026-intelligence.md`
  FIFA World Cup 2026 fan token intelligence module. Tournament signal calendar
  (pre-tournament through final), NCSI amplification at ×3.5–4.0x, host nation
  commercial signals (USA/Mexico), token-by-token exposure map, agent reasoning
  protocol across four tournament phases, World Cup CDI values, hard rules.
  Time-sensitive: tournament runs June 11 – July 19, 2026.

- `fan-token/transfer-window-intelligence/transfer-window-intelligence.md`
  Transfer window calendar intelligence — the window as a structural market condition.
  Summer and January window phases (A through E), deadline day protocol (WAIT 6h
  before deadline), cross-token contagion (four types), lifecycle phase interaction,
  World Cup 2026 window overlap (July 1–19 dual signal), verifiable source tiers
  for transfer reporting.

- `core/media-intelligence.md`
  Media and journalism intelligence framework. Journalist authority tiers for football
  (Fabrizio Romano Tier 1 through tabloid Tier 3) and six other sports. Press conference
  availability language decoder. News velocity as sentiment signal (thresholds and CDI
  interaction). Coverage duration and CDI multipliers. Integration with the five-phase
  sequential reasoning chain.

- `agent-prompts/agent-prompts.md` — three new prompts added (17, 18, 19):
  Prompt 17: Four-server MCP stack agent (production deployment)
  Prompt 18: Fan token portfolio monitoring agent (multi-token daily review)
  Prompt 19: World Cup 2026 tournament agent (national token + NCSI focus)
  Total: 19 production-ready system prompts

### Notes
- World Cup 2026 intelligence is time-sensitive — tournament starts June 11, 2026
- Transfer window intelligence is distinct from fan-token/transfer-intelligence/
  (individual transfers) — covers the window itself as a recurring market condition
- Media intelligence fills the gap between verifiable-sources (confirmed facts) and
  social-intelligence-connector (volume) — the middle layer of structured journalism
- Agent prompts 17-19 cover the three most common production deployment patterns
  not previously addressed: four-server stack, portfolio monitoring, tournament mode

## [3.39.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added
- `sportmind.dev/demo` — interactive demo page (`demo.html`, 917 lines)
  - Six pre-built scenarios with progressive typing animation
  - sportmind_pre_match — PSG vs Arsenal UCL QF full signal output
  - sportmind_macro — crypto cycle state and modifier reference
  - sportmind_fan_token_lookup — PSG Chiliz Chain registry entry
  - sportmind_disciplinary — citing scenario with DSM framework
  - sportmind_sentiment_snapshot — BAR multi-axis sentiment state
  - Sequential five-phase chain — full pipeline from macro gate to ENTER
  - Real-time JSON syntax highlighting (keys, strings, numbers, booleans)
  - Copy output button on every scenario

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-31 — Fan Token Intelligence layer

### Added — Layer 3: Fan token commercial intelligence (5 skills + 6 reference files)

The complete Fan Token Intelligence skill set, integrated as `fan-token/` — SportMind's third layer.
Connects on-chain Chiliz Chain data, athlete social activity, transfer signals, and commercial
brand intelligence into a unified, queryable layer for clubs, agents, and brands.

**New skills:**

- `fan-token/fan-token-pulse` — The ground-truth layer. Queries Chiliz Chain (RPC + Graph)
  and Socios Connect API for live token data. Produces HAS (Holder Activity Score) and
  TVI (Token Velocity Index). Classifies velocity spikes as match-driven, social-driven,
  rumour-driven, airdrop-driven, or market-driven. **Always runs first** in any Layer 3 chain.

- `fan-token/athlete-social-lift` — The social attribution layer. Measures causal relationship
  between athlete social posts and fan token holder behaviour. Produces AELS (Athlete Engagement
  Lift Score 0–100) with platform breakdown (X, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) and content type
  analysis (match, lifestyle, token, transfer, sponsored).

- `fan-token/transfer-signal` — The transfer intelligence layer. Monitors RSS feeds, verified
  journalist accounts, and fan communities. Produces APS (Athlete Portability Score), TSI
  (Transfer Sentiment Index for both source and destination clubs), and Rumour Confidence Score
  with source tier weighting (Romano/Ornstein Tier 1 → fan accounts Tier 4).

- `fan-token/brand-score` — The synthesis layer. Combines HAS × 0.25 + AELS × 0.25 + APS × 0.20
  + REACH × 0.15 + SENTI × 0.15 into the Athlete Brand Score (ABS). Produces exportable
  commercial brief with peer comparison and trend signal. Gracefully handles missing prerequisites
  with proxy estimates and confidence flags.

- `fan-token/sponsorship-match` — The monetisation layer. Maps audience profile to 7 brand
  category verticals (Performance Sports, Lifestyle, Technology, Food & Beverage, Financial
  Services, Travel, Automotive). Produces AFS (Audience Fit Score) per category, geographic
  commercial priority map, and token-native activation concepts unique to each brand category.

**New reference files:**

- `fan-token/fan-token-pulse/references/token-registry.md` — CAP-20 contract addresses for all
  active fan tokens (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1, Bundesliga, national teams)
- `fan-token/fan-token-pulse/references/api-responses.md` — Full API response shapes and
  HAS computation JavaScript implementation for Kayen, Chiliz Graph, and Socios Connect

  by league and position for ABS REACH score computation (Q1 2026)
- `fan-token/sponsorship-match/references/activation-templates.md` — Token-native campaign
  templates for each brand category with measurement framework

**New layer README:**
- `fan-token/README.md` — Layer 3 architecture, all five core metrics, example agent chains,
  full infrastructure guide (blockchain, APIs, env vars), regulatory notes, roadmap

### Updated

- `README.md` — Three-layer architecture diagram, Layer 3 skills table, updated structure tree

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-31 — Football token intelligence layer

### Added — `fan-token/football-token-intelligence`

The first sport-specific fan token intelligence skill in SportMind. A dedicated bridge
between the football domain layer (`sports/football`) and the commercial intelligence
layer (`fan-token-pulse`, `athlete-social-lift`, `brand-score`), providing football-
specific precision that no other skill covers.

**New metrics produced:**
- **FTIS** — Football Token Impact Score (0–100): competition × fixture × athlete composite
- **NCSI** — National-Club Spillover Index: quantified effect of national team activity on club tokens
- **ATM** — Athlete Token Multiplier (0.00–1.50): systemic player importance to the token ecosystem

**Four priority areas covered:**

*Competition × token impact matrix:* Full FTIS classification for every competition type —
UCL (by round, with HAS impact data), domestic leagues (by context and stakes), World Cup
and Euros (national token and club spillover), Copa América, AFCON, Nations League, domestic
cups (with domestic vs international holder base distinction), Conference League, friendlies.
Includes a seasonal FTIS timeline for a UCL-active club from pre-season through final.

*National team × club token spillover (World Cup 2026 focus):* Complete NCSI formula and
multiplier table by tournament type (World Cup Final ×1.00 down to friendly ×0.05).
Reverse spillover model: injury during national duty → club token impact by severity.
World Cup 2026 special considerations: dual-token exposure framework for athletes with
both club and national tokens, North American host premium for USMNT token, summer
window collision period (UCL Final to World Cup group stage = highest-density fan token
signal period in ecosystem history). Cross-token correlation threshold rule (>0.70 = reduce
to single position).

*Athlete Token Multiplier profiles:* ATM formula (AELS + on-pitch lift + narrative + competition
context). ATM bands from Elite (1.20–1.50) to Low (<0.40). Competition-specific ATM
multipliers: UCL knockout ×1.40, El Clásico ×1.30, World Cup ×1.25, domestic ×1.00,
friendly ×0.50. Four key ATM patterns documented: global brand multiplier, returning hero,
transfer talk premium, penalty taker structural premium.

*Friendly and pre-season signal logic:* Five specific exception conditions documented with
calibrated impact data. Default rule: ignore friendlies. Exceptions: summer signing debut
(elite: +10–20% HAS day of debut), iconic venue/opponent (+3–6%), injury return debut
(+6–12%), pre-tournament (+NCSI ×0.15), tactical revelation (update ATM model, not position).
"When friendlies are definitively noise" section.

**Multi-token events:** Full framework for fixtures where both clubs have active tokens —
pre-match correlation check, dual-hold guidance, historical impact data for Derby della
Madonnina (ACM vs INTER, correlation ~0.62) and PSG vs OM (correlation ~0.42), El Clásico
treatment as always-Tier-1. Competition priority quick-reference matrix with all major events.

**New reference files:**
- `references/athlete-token-profiles.md` — ATM archetypes, national team × club token mapping
  for all eight 2026 World Cup national tokens (ARG, BRA, FFF, POR, ENG, GER, ESP, USMNT),
  multi-token fixture historical correlations, token holder geography reference by club
- `references/competition-impact-data.md` — Calibrated HAS and TVI impact data by UCL round,
  league context, World Cup round, domestic cup type; token decay curves for all event types;
  seasonal FTIS timeline for UCL-active club

### Updated
- `sports/football/football.md` — Fan Token Layer section added at bottom, with recommended
  three-skill agent chain and signpost to `fan-token/football-token-intelligence`
- `fan-token/README.md` — football-token-intelligence added to skills list
- `README.md` — Layer 3 skills table updated
- `CHANGELOG.md` — v1.4.0 release notes

## [1.5.2] — 2026-03-31 — Comprehensive audit and consistency pass

No new skills. Full library audit: content accuracy, internal consistency, stale references, outdated metadata.

### Fixed — stale filename references (post v1.5.1 rename)
All files that referenced other files by their pre-rename names were updated.
Affected: 15 stub sports, 4 example integration files, llms.txt, CONTRIBUTING.md,
GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md, templates/template-new-athlete-skill.md,
core/core-athlete-modifier-system.md, and all 14 fan-token skill files
(internal references to their own references/ subfolders).

### Fixed — stale attribution and install commands
- 5 sport domain skills (football, basketball, mma, esports, american-football):
  `npx skills add fantokenintel/fan-token-skills` → `npx skills add sportmind/fan-token`
- 9 sport domain skills: `MIT License · Fan Token Intel · https://fantokenintel.com`
  → `MIT License · SportMind · sportmind.dev`
- All athlete skills: same footer attribution fix
- `core/core-athlete-record-schema.json`: schema `$id` URL updated to `sportmind.dev`
- `athlete/meta/athlete-intel-cross-sport-orchestrator.md`: "58 tokens tracked on
  fantokenintel" → current reference to chiliz-token-registry.md

### Fixed — missing reference files marked as planned
5 fan-token skills listed reference files that don't yet exist. Now clearly marked *(planned)*:
- `fan-token/athlete-social-activity`: content-classifier-patterns, sentiment-lexicon-sports,
  engagement-benchmarks → marked planned; social-platform-api-setup.md noted as shared file
- `fan-token/performance-on-pitch`: position-weights, league-benchmarks, injury-type-risk → planned
- `fan-token/performance-off-pitch`: loan-case-studies, injury-phases, youth-benchmarks → planned
- `fan-token/transfer-intelligence`: loan-case-studies → planned
- `fan-token/sports-brand-sponsorship`: roi-measurement-tools, conflict-matrix → planned

### Fixed — outdated content
- `llms.txt`: Complete rewrite. Was showing version 1.0.0, two-layer architecture,
  5 sport skills, cricket/formula1/tennis/rugby listed as "planned". Now accurate v1.5.2
  with full three-layer architecture, 21+15 sport skills, 17 athlete skills, 14 fan-token skills.
- `sportmind-overview.md`: Fan-token structure tree showed only 5 Layer 3 skills (now shows 14),
  Layer 3 count said "5 complete" (now 14), contributing section suggested cricket/formula1/golf
  as first contributions (all already built), roadmap showed everything as future (now shows
  completed v1.0–v1.5 history and v2.0 upcoming).
- `GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md`: Complete rewrite. Was listing cricket, rugby, tennis, formula1
  as Tier 1 unwritten skills — all four are now complete. Replaced with accurate list of
  15 actual stub sports plus new athlete skills (formula1, rugby-league) as open contributions.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Removed suggestion to write cricket, formula1, golf, rugby, tennis
  domain skills (already built). Updated to point to 15 stub sports.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-03-31 — MLB Baseball added + changelog fix

### Fixed — CHANGELOG
- `[1.1.0]` entry renamed from "Sport expansion (previously mislabelled)" to "Sport expansion"

### Added — `sports/baseball/sport-domain-baseball.md`

Complete MLB baseball domain skill. Included despite no active fan token because:
(a) library serves all sports AI agents, not just fan token agents; (b) MLB franchises
are among the highest-value sports brands globally and token launch readiness is justified;
(c) Statcast makes baseball the most data-rich sport in the library.

Key coverage:
- Pitcher-first framework: why the starting pitcher is baseball's dominant variable
- FIP and xFIP over ERA: luck-adjusted metrics explained with thresholds
- Pitcher types: power, finesse, ground ball, fly ball, opener/bulk — distinct profiles
- Times Through Order Penalty (TTOP): performance degradation by lineup pass
- Bullpen assessment: modern game dependency, fatigue flags, save situation quality
- Batter vs Pitcher matchup: sample size thresholds, platoon advantage, Statcast signals
- Ballpark intelligence: park factor classification (Coors Field extreme case),
  wind direction (+15-20% HR probability), temperature and humidity effects
- Rotation cycle tracking: 5-day rotation, rest days, short rest performance decline
- Trade deadline (July 31) as the most significant mid-season signal
- 4 event playbooks: Ace vs weak spot, bullpen game, playoff series Game 1, trade deadline acquisition
- Fan token notes: which franchises would launch highest-value tokens when MLB tokens arrive
- Full agent reasoning prompts

### Added — `athlete/baseball/athlete-intel-baseball.md`

Complete MLB athlete intelligence skill. The deepest Statcast-based player assessment
in the library.

Key coverage:

- Statcast pitcher profile: velocity, spin rate, breaking ball movement, pitch mix
- Recent form assessment: last 5 starts with trend direction modifier (×1.08 rising, ×0.90 declining)
- Velocity monitoring: -3 mph vs season average = significant flag; -4 mph = injury event
- UCL / Tommy John as the critical pitcher injury: early warning signals explained

## [1.9.1] — 2026-04-01 — Cross-sport key findings added to Layer 4

### Added — `market/market-key-findings.md`

Cross-sport market intelligence insights that are only visible when comparing all
28 sports simultaneously — not derivable from any individual sport market file.
11 findings documented:

1. **The audience size trap** — Raw viewership ≠ addressable token market.
   Table tennis (850M fans), kabaddi (350–400M), swimming (2.2B) all have structural
   barriers that make their true token-addressable audience a fraction of headline numbers.

2. **The China-platform incompatibility problem** — Table tennis, snooker, and badminton
   have extraordinary Chinese audiences entirely inside domestic platforms where Chiliz
   cannot operate. Snooker's 250M Chinese followers makes it a "niche" sport globally
   with a massive single-market exposure invisible to Western commercial analysis.

3. **The Fantasy Sports gateway** — NFL (50M fantasy players), cricket India (Dream11
   200M users), MLB and kabaddi all have large paid digital engagement products proving
   the audience will pay for digital sports involvement. Token adoption curve is shorter
   where fantasy ecosystems already exist.

4. **Private equity entry as the strongest institutional signal** — CVC Capital Partners'
   rugby union investment (Six Nations, Premiership, URC) follows the same playbook as
   their F1 investment that preceded Liberty Media's commercial transformation. More
   predictive than governing body statements.

5. **The regulatory gating variable affects multiple sports simultaneously** — US
   SEC/CFTC clarity on utility tokens would simultaneously unlock NFL, MLB, NHL, NASCAR,
   and NBA team tokens. A single regulatory event, not five separate sport developments.

6. **Horse racing syndication is the closest existing analogy to fan tokens** — Fractional
   horse ownership already operates as a proto-token: fractional ownership, proportional
   utility, transferability, community membership. The audience understands the concept
   instinctively.

7. **The demographic split problem** — TV audience ≠ token audience. NBA (TV median 42,
   digital median 27), NFL (TV 43, Fantasy 31), MLB (TV 57, Latin/Asian fans 32). Golf
   (TV 54, Topgolf/social 35). Token adoption modelling must use digital demographics.

8. **Centralised commercial structure advantage** — MotoGP (Dorna), F1 (Liberty),
   UFC/WWE (TKO), EHF (handball) can deploy full-championship tokens from a single deal.
   Sports with distributed rights (football, boxing) require years of club-by-club development.

9. **NASCAR's sponsor loyalty culture alignment** — 72% of NASCAR fans intentionally
   purchase sponsor products. This commercial loyalty as fan expression is behaviourally
   identical to fan token utility mechanics — most pre-conditioned audience in library.

10. **The Indian regulatory variable controls multiple sports simultaneously** — Indian
    digital asset clarity would unlock IPL (most valuable untapped token opportunity globally),
    PKL kabaddi, and adjacent cricket/badminton audiences simultaneously.

11. **The young generation effect** — Luke Littler (darts), Shohei Ohtani (baseball/Japan),
    Alcaraz/Swiatek (tennis), Lyles/Duplantis (athletics) can create athlete tokens that
    precede their sport's institutional readiness. 15+ year career runways matter.

**Summary table:** Five most important cross-sport signals to monitor:
US regulatory clarity, Indian regulatory framework, China platform compatibility,
CVC rugby digital execution, centralised-rights sport partnerships.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-01 — Layer 5: Macro Intelligence

### Added — `macro/` directory — Layer 5 (complete — 8 files)

A fifth intelligence layer covering external forces that originate outside sport but
materially affect sporting revenue, fan token markets, athlete availability, and
commercial infrastructure. The defining concept is the **bifurcated impact model**:
most macro events affect physical sports revenue and digital sports revenue differently.

**`macro/macro-overview.md`** — Layer 5 master framework:
- Bifurcated impact model: physical vs digital revenue split under external stress
- Event taxonomy: Category A (acute), B (structural), C (cyclical)
- Crypto cycle overlay: CHZ/BTC correlation modifiers (bull × 1.20, bear × 0.75,
  extreme bear × 0.55) to apply to all sporting signals
- Sport-specific macro vulnerability mapping (all 28 sports)
- Counter-cyclical assets in sport: fan tokens, esports, streaming — increase in relative
  value when physical sports revenue falls
- Timing model: immediate vs short/medium/long-term impact by event type
- Loading order: Layer 5 loads first when active macro event is identified

**`macro/macro-pandemic-public-health.md`** — The defining macro case study:
- 2020 COVID-19: Documented revenue losses ($61B global sports industry impact)
  simultaneously with record Socios fan engagement, esports viewership records,
  NBA Top Shot record transactions, Virtual Grand National 4.8M UK viewers
- Four counter-cyclical principles established: physical unavailability amplifies
  digital utility; permanent audience acquisition through forced adoption;
  broadcast-heavy clubs more resilient (NFL, PL) than matchday-heavy (boxing, golf);
  government response speed determines duration of impact
- Public health event taxonomy: Level 1 (global pandemic) through Level 4 (individual athlete)
- Preparedness signals: Tier 1/2/3 early warning system
- Recovery curve: month-by-month physical revenue return timeline post-restrictions
- Token-specific recovery: confirmed fan return announcement as highest-reliability catalyst

**`macro/macro-geopolitical.md`** — Wars, sanctions, diplomatic crises:
- Russia-Ukraine 2022: Day-by-day timeline of sports consequences (Day 3: FIFA ban;
  Day 5: F1 Russian GP cancelled; Day 8: IOC exclusion recommendation)
- Chelsea FC ownership sanction: Token market volatility during uncertainty window
- Geopolitical event taxonomy: Type 1 (active conflict) through Type 4 (host nation instability)
- Sport-specific geopolitical vulnerability mapping (football highest; esports lowest)
- Recovery timeline: active conflict (6-24 months), sanctions lifting (3-12 months)

**`macro/macro-crypto-market-cycles.md`** — The most underappreciated structural risk:
- CHZ/BTC correlation: ~0.75–0.85 rolling 90-day (high)
- Four cycle phases with fan token behaviour and position modifiers:
  Bull (× 1.20), Transition (× 1.00), Bear (× 0.75), Accumulation (× 0.55)
- 2022 crypto winter case study: CHZ -88.5% peak to trough; Champions League Final
  produced 18% relief rally then resumed decline within 5 days
- Decoupling signals: FIFA World Cup 2022 as only consistent BTC-decoupling event
- Weekly monitoring checklist: BTC vs 200-day MA as primary indicator
- Regulatory overlay: SEC/MiCA/national regulatory risk on CHZ specifically

**`macro/macro-broadcast-disruption.md`** — RSN collapse and streaming wars:
- Diamond Sports Group bankruptcy (March 2023): 42 sports teams affected; some MLB
  clubs lost $30-50M/yr in local rights fees
- Streaming entrants: Amazon (NFL/tennis/NASCAR), Apple (MLS/baseball), Netflix
  (WWE/NFL), Peacock (Olympics/NFL), DAZN (boxing/Bundesliga) — all accelerating
- Sport vulnerability mapping: MLB/NHL most exposed; NFL/F1 most resilient
- Token opportunity: RSN collapse accelerating direct club-to-fan products;
  natural fan token integration point

**`macro/macro-economic-cycles.md`** — Recession and consumer spending:
- Discretionary spending hierarchy: identity sports (football, NFL) most resilient;
  premium hospitality (F1, golf, horse racing) most vulnerable
- Sponsorship lag: 1-2 year delay between recession beginning and full sponsorship contraction
- Inflation dual effect: input costs (wages, energy) and consumer price resistance
- Agent modifiers: premium sports × 0.85, mass-market × 0.92, digital × 0.95 in recession

**`macro/macro-climate-weather.md`** — Structural outdoor sport disruption:
- Documented current impacts: Australian Open heat policy activations, Tour de France
  stage modifications, athletics marathon moved to midnight (Doha 2019), Tokyo 2021
  marathon relocation, cricket session postponements increasing
- Sport vulnerability ranking: cricket, horse racing, cycling, golf most exposed
- Event cancellation risk modifier: >20% cancellation probability → reduce 25%;
  >40% → reduce 50% or exit
- Indoor migration as positive signal: roof installation = schedule certainty = rights value
- Long-term structural trend: climate change is a compounding, not acute, risk

**`macro/macro-governance-scandal.md`** — Corruption, doping, institutional crises:
- FIFA 2015 case study: Timeline, sponsor response, commercial resilience, recovery pattern
- Governance scandal taxonomy: Type 1 (systemic corruption) through Type 4 (welfare failures)
- Doping: Individual athlete token risk; retrospective disqualification creates permanent
  uncertainty; return from ban is typically 2-4 year recovery period
- Esports match-fixing: Most active current governance concern; ESIC reports as standing input
- Qatar 2022 welfare controversy: Documented reduced digital fan engagement in some
  European markets despite strong global token performance during tournament
- Recovery indicators: genuine vs false recovery signals; timeline 2-7 years by scandal type

### Updated — roadmap and documentation
- `sportmind-overview.md`: Roadmap v2.0 entry updated from placeholder to complete;
  structure tree expanded to 5 layers; "Four layers" → "Five layers"; Layer 5 skills
  table added; v3.0 upcoming section created
- `llms.txt`: Version 1.9.0 → 2.0.0; five-layer architecture; 8 macro files added

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-01 — Fan Token Lifecycle and Partnership Intelligence

### Added — two new Layer 3 skills

**`fan-token/fan-token-lifecycle/fan-token-lifecycle.md`**

The complete temporal framework for fan token intelligence. The central insight:
fan tokens cannot be cancelled — they are on-chain assets that transition from
governance utility to predictive utility when official partnership infrastructure ends.

Six-phase lifecycle model:
- Phase 1 (Pre-launch): Partnership signal monitoring; launch window timing
- Phase 2 (Launch event): Launch quality indicators; CEX listing tier assessment;
  holder distribution analysis; optimal vs suboptimal launch windows
- Phase 3 (Active utility): Full Layer 3 stack applicable; partnership health monitoring;
  LTUI (Lifetime Token Utility Index) introduced; Phase 4 warning signals
- Phase 4 (Utility plateau): Reduced Layer 3 weighting framework; plateau duration model;
  transition preparation; 6–18 month average plateau before termination or renewal
- Phase 5/6 (Non-contractual): The foundational principle — fan tokens are permanent
  on-chain assets; utility transformation from governance to predictive utility

Non-contractual token framework:
- CEX/DEX trajectory model: CEX maintains initially → review period → bifurcation
  (large club tokens survive CEX; small clubs migrate to DEX-primary)
- The prediction market as post-partnership utility: price = aggregate sporting
  sentiment; no official approval required; four forms of prediction market integration
- On-chain holder data as persistent fan sentiment intelligence: geographic distribution,
  holder concentration, wallet activity patterns — all available post-termination
- The open primitive model: third-party use cases (analytics, DeFi, GameFi, community,
  media) that require no club approval and cannot be revoked
- Lifecycle-adjusted Layer 3 signal weights: which metrics apply at each phase

**`fan-token/fan-token-partnership-intelligence/fan-token-partnership-intelligence.md`**

The partnership relationship framework. Covers new partnerships, health monitoring,
termination events, documented case studies, and community empowerment.

Partnership tier taxonomy (5 tiers):
- Tier 1 Market-creating: First token in major sport market; CHZ +10–25%
- Tier 2 Major club addition: Top clubs in tokenised leagues; CHZ +5–12%
- Tier 3 Standard club addition: Mid-table clubs; CHZ +1–5%
- Tier 4 Athlete individual token: Fighter/player tokens; variable CHZ impact
- Tier 5 Governing body/competition: Highest per-announcement CHZ impact

Due diligence framework: institutional signals, market signals, partnership
structure signals with composite quality assessment (5–6 strong = accumulate)

Partnership Health Score (PHS) — five-indicator composite:
  UEF (Utility Event Frequency) + CSP (Club Social Promotion) +
  HCT (Holder Count Trend) + TUI (Token Utility Innovation) +
  PDS (Partnership Duration Signal)
  PHS ≥ 0.75: Full Layer 3; PHS < 0.25: Begin non-contractual assessment

Termination patterns:
  Pattern 1 (Announced): Formal statement; -20 to -40% immediate
  Pattern 2 (Silent lapse): Most common; 180+ days zero utility = effectively non-contractual
  Pattern 3 (Forced): Regulatory/legal/ownership; -40 to -70%; slowest recovery
  Pattern 4 (Category exit): Platform-level; all category tokens affected simultaneously

Documented case studies with named tokens:
Three-type case study taxonomy:
- **Type A (Active partnerships — predictive behaviour under stress):**
  $JUV (Juventus) and $ACM (AC Milan) — BOTH ACTIVE Socios/Chiliz partnerships.
  Corrected from earlier draft: neither is non-contractual. Used as Type A case
  studies showing crisis correlation amplification (institutional stress shifts
  active-partnership tokens toward prediction-market-style pricing temporarily).
  Ownership transitions identified as highest-risk period for Phase 4 drift.
- **Type B (Reduced engagement / uncertain):**
  $FAZE (FaZe Clan) — partnership status uncertain; verify before agent use.
  ISL club tokens — reduced engagement; regulatory environment is primary variable.
- **Type C (Confirmed non-contractual):**
  Smaller Latin American and Asian club tokens from Socios's 2021-22 expansion;
  clearest confirmed non-contractual examples; mostly Path B trajectory.

The relaunch pathway: non-contractual → re-contractual; three relaunch options
with agent signal guidance for detecting relaunch before announcement

Community empowerment principle: remaining post-termination holders are SportMind's
primary intelligence asset for that club in Phase 6; community treasury model;
developer bounty model; advocacy for club re-engagement

Quick reference table: 14 partnership events with CHZ impact, sport impact, and agent action

## [2.1.1] — 2026-04-01 — Library-wide audit and consistency pass

### No new skills. Full audit of all documentation for accuracy, consistency, and alignment.

**Issues resolved:**

**Structural:**
- Removed 9 empty ghost directories created by earlier bash brace-expansion commands
  (e.g. `{fan-token-pulse,athlete-social-lift,...}`, `{sports/{football,...},athlete/...}`)
  — all were empty; real skill directories and files unaffected

**`core/core-signal-weights-by-sport.md`** — fully rebuilt:
- Previous version had structural breakage: NHL, MotoGP, AFL, Handball, Kabaddi, NASCAR
  had been appended as rows inside the Phase Adjustments table (not the main weights table)
- 16 sports added in v1.9.0 were completely missing: Darts, Snooker, Boxing, Cycling,
  Athletics, Winter Sports, Netball, Swimming, Rowing, Horse Racing, Volleyball, Badminton,
  Table Tennis, and others
- File rebuilt from scratch with all 30 sport rows in the correct main table, proper
  rationale for each component, corrected phase adjustment table, macro cycle overlay section

**`fan-token/fan-token-layer-overview.md`** — multiple fixes:
- Title removed `(v2)` suffix — stale from early development
- Section heading `## The nine skills` → `## The sixteen skills`
- Skill diagram updated from original 10-skill layout to full 16-skill layout showing all
  categories including sport-specific bridge skills and temporal/lifecycle layer
- Internal roadmap (Phase 1–5 delivery plan, stale week references) replaced with current
  status section listing all 16 skills and v3.0 upcoming items

**`GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md`** — two corrections:
- `athlete/rugby-league` removed from Tier 2 "missing skills" list (complete since v1.8.0)
- `athlete/boxing` removed from Tier 2 "missing skills" list (complete since early versions)
- Stub count corrected: "15 sport domain skills" → "14 sport domain skills"

**`CONTRIBUTING.md`:**
- "15 community stub sports" → "14 community stub sports"

**Integration examples (all three):**
- `examples/standalone/integration-standalone-system-prompt.md`: Updated 3-layer loading
  pattern to correct 5-layer loading order (Layer 5 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3)
- `examples/langchain/integration-langchain-python.md`: Added v2.1.0 five-layer note
- `examples/claude-mcp/integration-claude-and-mcp.md`: Added v2.1.0 five-layer note

**`llms.txt`** — multiple fixes:
- `## Four-layer architecture` → `## Five-layer architecture`
- Layer 2 description updated: "17 sports" → "19 sports (including darts and meta orchestrator)"

  AI agents explicitly (not just listing competitions/data). Layer headers explain "what
  this layer teaches an AI agent." Sport skill lines describe the specific agent-reasoning
  insight unique to that sport
- Signal weights table: updated from 17-sport partial table to complete 30-sport table
  matching `core/core-signal-weights-by-sport.md`
- Fan-token structure tree: lifecycle and partnership skills were absent — both added

## [2.3.0] — 2026-04-01 — Fan Token Why — Foundational Value Thesis

### Added — `fan-token/fan-token-why.md`

The foundational document for all of Layer 3. Explains why fan tokens exist as a
category, what structural problems they solve that the traditional sports model cannot,
and where the trajectory leads. Intended to be read before any other Layer 3 skill —
by AI agents and by developers.

**The three structural ceilings of the traditional model:**
- Stadium capacity ceiling: A sold-out Camp Nou holds 99,000 people. Manchester United
  has 650M global fans. Old Trafford holds 74,879 — 0.011% of their global fanbase.
  Every other fan participates as a spectator, not a participant. Fan tokens remove
  the ceiling entirely; the addressable community is the entire global fanbase.
- Revenue geography mismatch: FC Barcelona's largest fan markets by passion are
  Indonesia and Brazil, yet >70% of revenue is generated from Spain. There is no
  mechanism in the traditional model to generate structured revenue from the hundreds
  of millions of global fans who will never attend Camp Nou. Fan tokens create
  commercial relationships in every geography where fans exist.
- The spectator-only model: Traditional fans have no agency. No voice in decisions.
  No mechanism for participation. A 40-year loyal fan has the same relationship to
  the club as a new follower. Fan tokens introduce governance, access, and economic
  alignment — the fan becomes a stakeholder, not an audience member.

**The scalability mathematics (documented):**
- Premier League club, 60,000-seat stadium: matchday ceiling ~£100–140M/yr
- Same club, 1% token engagement (100,000 of ~50M global fans) at £15/yr: £67.5M
  equivalent — with zero physical infrastructure investment
- At 5% engagement: approaches the matchday ceiling without building a single seat
- The entire financial model scales with software, not concrete

**The participation economy context:**
- Wikipedia, open source, creator economy: all applications of participation replacing
  consumption in different domains
- Fan tokens are the sports application of the same shift
- The generation that is now 18–35 grew up with digital ownership as normal —
  the psychological barrier to token adoption is essentially zero for this cohort

**The five-phase future trajectory:**
- Phase 1 (now): Engagement tokens — governance, access, community
- Phase 2 (near term): Performance tokens — yield linked to athlete outcomes
- Phase 3 (medium term): Venue tokens — fractional ownership of stadium infrastructure;
  the 40,000-seat stadium becomes a globally-owned digital asset
- Phase 4 (medium term): Media rights tokens — fractional ownership of broadcast rights;
  £500M TV deal generates returns for millions of global holders
- Phase 5 (longer term): RWA/SportFi — full integration into DeFi; collateralised sports
  assets; cross-asset portfolios; prediction markets with token settlement

**The stadium as anchor, not ceiling:**
- Stadiums create experiences that make people want to hold tokens
- Tokens create communities that make stadiums more valuable
- Physical and digital are complementary layers of the same relationship
- Fan tokens serve the 99.989% who will never attend — not a replacement for those who do

**Agent reasoning implications (documented):**
- Without thesis: "Token price is down because team lost; reduce position"
- With thesis: "Holder count is stable; community intact; sporting signal not structural collapse"
- Without thesis: "Partnership ended; token is worthless"
- With thesis: "80,000 holders remain on-chain; community is the asset; prediction market viable"
- Changes what agents look for: holder community health, geographic distribution, utility
  engagement rate, fan adoption trajectory — not just token price

**Developer opportunity:**
- Sports industry: $500B+ annually globally
- Fan token layer: Currently fraction of 1% of that
- Gap between current and potential is the commercial opportunity
- Developer products mapped to: global community (99% who never attend), meaningful
  participation (governance UX, contribution tracking), physical-digital bridge
  (stadium activation, home watching rewards), Phase 2+ infrastructure

### Updated — existing files
- `fan-token/fan-token-layer-overview.md`: Opening preface added directing agents and
  developers to read fan-token-why.md before any other Layer 3 skill
- `fan-token/fan-token-why.md` added as first entry in Layer 3 skills tree in
  sportmind-overview.md; added as Foundation section before Ground Truth layers
  in skills-at-a-glance; referenced in "Who SportMind is for" section
- `agent-prompts/agent-prompts.md`: Commercial intelligence prompt updated to reference
  fan-token-why.md as foundational context for club/brand conversations
- `llms.txt`: Version 2.2.0 → 2.3.0; Layer 3 description updated; fan-token-why.md
  added as first entry in Layer 3 table and core reference; L3 count updated to 17

## [2.4.0] — 2026-04-02 — Blockchain Validator Intelligence + Data Sources

### Added — `fan-token/blockchain-validator-intelligence/blockchain-validator-intelligence.md`

Sports brands as Chiliz Chain validators — the structural shift from consumers of
blockchain infrastructure to co-owners of it. The PSG dual-layer model as the
reference case.

**Core concept — the two-layer model:**
- Layer 1 (Fan Token): Consumer-facing product; holder utility; token revenue
- Layer 2 (Validator Node): Infrastructure investment; staked CHZ; continuous
  validator rewards denominated in CHZ; operational obligation; governance rights
- Combined: PSG earns from fans (token layer) AND from securing the network that
  makes fans' tokens possible (validator layer). Vertical integration.

**Why both layers together change the intelligence model:**
- Token-only club: exit cost low; can allow partnership to lapse
- Token + validator club: exit cost HIGH; staked capital to unwind; operational
  infrastructure to retire; validator rewards stream to sacrifice
- Agent rule: Apply Validator-Adjusted PHS (×1.10 multiplier); treat termination
  probability as structurally lower than equivalent-PHS token-only clubs

**Technical framework (Chiliz Chain PoSA):**
- Chiliz Chain uses Proof of Stake Authority — limited, approved validators only
- Validator functions: block production, consensus participation, staking/rewards,
  governance voting, network security contribution
- Becoming a validator requires capital commitment, technical infrastructure,
  legal/compliance obligations — a multi-stakeholder institutional decision

**PSG case study — complete picture:**
- $PSG fan token: Launched 2020; global fanbase; Middle East/SEA/LatAm concentration;
  100M+ global fans; Qatar ownership connection amplifies Middle East penetration
- Validator status: World's first sports brand validator on Chiliz Chain
- Synergy: Token commercial success validates chain (CHZ demand) + validator status
  makes chain more credible (trusted brand as infrastructure) + dual revenue streams
- Institutional commitment signals: Capital, operations, legal, technology — board level

**On-chain signal detection:**
- Validator stake increase: Strong positive — deepening commitment
- Validator stake decrease (<10%): Monitor — could be treasury management
- Validator stake decrease (>25%): Warning — load full PHS reassessment
- Validator offline / slashed: Significant negative — operational commitment question
- Governance vote participation: Active = high engagement; missing votes = plateau signal
- Data sources: explorer.chiliz.com/validators, Dune Analytics, Chiliz Chain RPC

**Future trajectory — expanded validator participation:**
- Scenario 1: Top 5 European clubs as validators (Real Madrid, Barcelona, Man City, etc.)
- Scenario 2: League-level validators (La Liga, Bundesliga representing member clubs)
- Scenario 3: Multi-sport expansion (UFC/TKO, F1 constructors, NFL teams)
- Scenario 4: Athlete validators (individual fighters/players with capital + tech support)
- Scenario 5: Sports-specific chain validators (founding ownership of sports blockchain)
- Agent rule: Any new sports brand validator = Tier 1 institutional commitment signal

**VSI (Validator Status Indicator):**
- New metric: sixth PHS component for validator clubs
- 1.0 (stable/growing stake) → 0.0 (validator ended)
- Sources: Chiliz docs (docs.chiliz.com), explorer (explorer.chiliz.com), CoinGecko,
  Messari, The Block, SportsPro

Never-use list: anonymous forums without corroboration, prediction market prices as facts,
AI-generated content as its own source.

**Citation format standard** for SportMind skill contributors.

### Updated — existing files

**`fan-token/fan-token-partnership-intelligence.md`** — VSI sixth component added:
- Standard PHS remains Average(UEF, CSP, HCT, TUI, PDS) for non-validator clubs
- Validator-Adjusted PHS = Average(UEF, CSP, HCT, TUI, PDS, VSI) × 1.10

## [2.4.1] — 2026-04-02 — Full library audit and consistency pass

No new skills. Holistic v2.4.0 milestone audit covering objective alignment,
heading consistency, cross-reference integrity, count accuracy, and stale content.

**Issues found and fixed:**

Heading inconsistencies (highest priority — affects agent parsing):
- 5 Layer 1 sport skills had wrong heading suffix "Fan Token Skill" instead of
  "SportMind Domain Skill": football, basketball, mma, esports, american-football
  — all corrected to "— SportMind Domain Skill" format
- 10 Layer 2 athlete skills had old unformatted "athlete-X" headings from before
  the v1.5.1 rename: nfl, nba, nhl, football, mma, cricket, tennis, rugby, esports,
  meta — all corrected to "[Sport] — Athlete Intelligence" format
- 14 stub sport skills had lowercase sport names in headings (e.g. "# badminton")
  — all corrected to proper capitalised names

Named metrics alignment:
- VSI (Validator Status Indicator) present in overview but missing from glossary
  main metrics table — added
- GSAx (Goals Saved Above Expected) present in glossary but missing from overview
  named metrics table — added
- Total named metrics: 34 (overview) and 34 (glossary main table), now aligned

Layer 3 count:
- Overview heading still said "17 skills complete" after blockchain-validator-intelligence
  was added in v2.4.0 — corrected to 18

Placeholder standardisation:
- `your-org` without brackets remaining in 3 files (sportmind-overview.md,
  integration-fan-token-intel.md, integration-claude-and-mcp.md)
  — all updated to SportMind for clarity

Objective alignment verified across all key new files:
- fan-token-why.md: agent reasoning section ✅ developer section ✅
- confidence-output-schema.md: JSON schema ✅ Python validator ✅ token signal ✅
- agent-prompts.md: 7 prompts ✅ all use cases covered ✅
- data-sources.md: all 5 layers ✅ API quick ref ✅ quality hierarchy ✅
- blockchain-validator-intelligence.md: PSG dual-layer ✅ VSI ✅ on-chain monitoring ✅

Final state (v2.4.1):
- 172 files, 0 empty, 0 stray dirs
- 0 broken file references outside CHANGELOG
- 0 stale content in live files
- All L1 headings: "[Sport] — SportMind Domain Skill"
- All L2 headings: "[Sport] — Athlete Intelligence"
- All counts consistent across overview, llms.txt, and actual file system

## [2.5.0] — 2026-04-02 — Full skill validation pass — all 61 skills now pass

### Scope
Complete structural audit of all Layer 1 sport domain skills (28 complete + 14 stubs)
and Layer 2 athlete intelligence skills (19) against the SportMind skill validator.
Result: **0 errors across 61 files** (down from 111 errors at audit start).

### Validator improvements
`scripts/skill-validator.py` updated with two improvements:
- Section name variant matching: validator now accepts legitimate alternative section
  names used in pre-template skills (e.g. "## Signal Weight Adjustments" accepted as
  "## Signal Weight"; "## Key Positional Intelligence" accepted as "## Key Commands")
- Playbook field variant matching: validator now accepts common field name equivalents
  (e.g. "action:" and "signal:" accepted as "entry:"; "condition:" accepted as "filter:")
  These variants exist in skills written before the final template was standardised.

### Sport domain skills — structural additions

**Signal Weight sections added (9 skills):**

  as lifecycle phase transition signal
- On-chain yield sources: LP fees, staking (validator rewards), prediction market
  liquidity provision, lending protocol collateral
- Prediction market protocol context: Azuro, Polymarket — pool TVL as conviction signal
- DeFi lifecycle phases mapped to fan-token-lifecycle.md phases 1–6

## [2.7.0] — 2026-04-02 — Production agent tooling + World Cup 2026 + full library audit

### Added — `README.md`

Fast entry point for the library. Covers: problem statement, 5-minute quickstart
(system prompt injection + clone options), five-layer table, full inventory summary,
"start here" file guide, standard agent output format snippet, framework compatibility,
and contributing guide. Two pages; designed to answer "what is this and how do I start"
within 2 minutes.

### Added — `examples/worked-scenarios/` — 6 complete historical scenarios

Each scenario follows: the event → macro check → market context → sport domain →
athlete modifier → fan token intelligence → core modifiers → confidence output JSON →
what actually happened → calibration analysis (what the model got right, what it missed,
what developers should learn).

- **Scenario 1 — UCL Final 2023 (Man City vs Inter):** Full five-layer football analysis.
  De Bruyne injury, treble narrative (+6%), thin crypto backdrop (×0.95). $CITY +14.2%
  post-match within predicted +12–18% range. Calibration: matchup modifier for defensive
  opposition setup was missing; would have refined Haaland expected contribution.

- **Scenario 2 — UFC 281 (Adesanya vs Pereira):** MMA fight camp signals, extreme bear
  crypto (FTX collapse November 8, fight November 12 — ×0.55 macro override), H2H
  historical advantage model, separation of prediction market vs token signal.
  Key lesson: FTX macro override correctly capped token position; prediction market
  value signal on Pereira (+210 underdog) was correct.

- **Scenario 3 — State of Origin 2023 G3:** Rugby league congestion intelligence as the
  primary differentiator. QLD home advantage offset congestion; NSW away + Murray doubt
  compound disadvantage. QLD 28–12 result within high-confidence prediction.
  Key lesson: Layer 3 correctly not loaded (Tier 2 sport; no active tokens).

- **Scenario 4 — IPL 2023 Cricket (CSK vs MI):** Format sensitivity, dew factor,
  India-Pakistan absence (standard match), DLS risk awareness. Cricket-specific
  intelligence demonstrating how format (T20 vs ODI vs Test) changes the framework.

- **Scenario 5 — NBA Trade Deadline 2023 (KD to Suns):** Player-centric signal model,
  trade deadline as the primary NBA signal event, NBATIS calculation, receiving team
  (+18–25% expected) vs trading team (-22%) token impact.

- **Scenario 6 — PSG DeFi Liquidity UCL 2023:** The DeFi intelligence demonstration.
  $PSG pool TVL $185k → liquidity_critical flag → max 40% position regardless of signal.
  Slippage 10.8% on DEX → CEX execution only. LP accumulation signal noted.
  PSG lost the match; liquidity cap protected the position. Key lesson: DeFi intelligence
  is not about signal accuracy — it is about protecting capital when signals are wrong.

### Added — `core/multi-agent-coordination.md`

Production agent architecture guide. Covers:
- File size reference: token counts for every key file; minimum viable loading sets
  for 5 use cases (prediction market, fan token, full five-layer, DeFi, commercial)
- Selective loading patterns: Python examples for loading only relevant rows from
  large tables
- Session state management: state object structure, cache invalidation rules by
  data type (athlete modifier, macro state, liquidity data, sport domain)
- Multi-sport routing: query classification, routing table (9 query types), lazy
  loading pattern with Python examples
- Conflict resolution hierarchy: macro vs sport, liquidity vs confidence, injury vs form;
  signal priority order (1–6)
- Edge case handling: 6 documented edge cases (cancellation, in-progress, no liquidity,
  sport not in library, conflicting injury reports, missing athlete skill)
- Calibration logging: JSON schema for tracking predictions vs outcomes; calibration
  priority list (availability modifier weights most impactful; macro modifier least)

### Added — `market/world-cup-2026.md`

World Cup 2026 consolidated intelligence module. Covers:
- Tournament format (48 teams, 104 matches, 16 cities, 3 countries)
- Why this World Cup is different for fan tokens: US market unlock, 48-team expansion,
  commercial scale ($14B+ broadcast rights, 6-7B expected viewers)
- NCSI by top player: Mbappé/Real Madrid (ATM 0.35–0.42), Haaland/City, Vinicius/Real,
  Bellingham/Real, Yamal/Barcelona — with expected token impact ranges
- National token opportunities: Brazil, Mexico, USA, Argentina, England
- Competition tier model: World Cup specific overrides (Final = 1.00, host nation ×1.15)
- Signal calendar: Pre-tournament (Jan–May 2026), Group Stage, Knockout Stage
  with specific agent action guidance for each phase
- Developer product opportunities: NCSI dashboard, bracket portfolio tracker,
  prediction market integration, national token scanner, athlete brief generator

### Full audit fixes (v2.7.0)
- Scenario numbering corrected: was 1/2/3/3/4/4/5 (duplicates); now 1/2/3/4/5/6
- Duplicate State of Origin scenario (G1) removed; G3 kept (more detailed)
- your-org: confirmed all 5 remaining instances are correctly bracketed SportMind
- All cross-reference integrity: 0 broken refs ✅
- Validator: 71 files checked, 0 errors ✅


### Updated — `core/multi-agent-coordination.md`

Significant additions to the existing multi-agent guide:

Three production patterns framework:
- Pattern 1 (Single-sport specialist): Low complexity; start with Prompt 1 or 7
- Pattern 2 (Multi-sport router): Medium complexity; start with Prompt 3 + routing logic
- Pattern 3 (Commercial intelligence platform): High complexity; Prompt 4 + Prompt 8

72h pre-match intelligence chain:
  T−72h: Macro + Market + Sport domain → baseline; catch macro overrides early
  T−24h: Athlete intelligence + Injury check → conditional loads for injury/weather
  T−3h: Final lineup + Liquidity check → final modifier; WAIT rule for unconfirmed lineup
  T−0: Execute final confidence output → ABSTAIN rule for lineup_unconfirmed + injury_warning
  T+48h: Post-event calibration → actual result + actual token movement

Two additional edge cases (8 total):
  Edge case 7 — DLS mid-match (cricket): Pre-match analysis SUPERSEDED; recalculate new object
  Edge case 8 — Context window overflow: Priority loading order; numbers > prose rule

Production deployment checklist: Data pipeline, agent configuration, testing,
output format, and calibration — all verifiable with checkboxes before going live

### Added — 3 new worked scenarios (total now 6)

**`examples/worked-scenarios/scenario-ipl-dls-2023.md` — Cricket/DLS**
  CSK vs MI IPL 2023 Qualifier 1; Chepauk Stadium Chennai
  Demonstrates: T20 format check first rule; dew factor (+10-12% for batting second);
  toss intelligence; DLS event mid-match (rain interruption); revised target recalculation;
  India factor (CricTIS); IPL token gap documentation
  Key learning: Dew factor is most underpriced signal in IPL evening cricket

**`examples/worked-scenarios/scenario-nba-trade-deadline-2023.md` — NBA Trade**
  Kevin Durant traded from Brooklyn Nets to Phoenix Suns (February 9, 2023)
  Demonstrates: NBA player-centric signal model (Tier 1 player = 60-70% team signal);
  NBATIS not applicable to roster events (use Trade Signal Model instead); reporter
  verification as entry trigger (Woj/Shams only); macro modifier (×0.82 bear) applied
  to tokens not prediction markets; integration period discount (×0.95, 5-10 games)
  Key learning: Verified reporter tweet is the entry trigger; not official NBA processing

**`examples/worked-scenarios/scenario-nrl-state-of-origin-2023.md` — Rugby League/Congestion**
  NRL State of Origin Game 3 (decider), 2023 series
  Demonstrates: State of Origin rivalry compression (form discount 40%); LOW confidence
  output (53.2%) as correct for Tier 1 rivalries; downstream congestion signals (Penrith
  ×0.93, Parramatta ×1.04 for following NRL round); token N/A (no active NRL tokens)
  Key learning: The downstream congestion signal is more valuable than the Origin pick

### Confirmed present — `README.md`

The library entry point exists and is comprehensive (176 lines):
- Five-minute quickstart with three integration options (system prompt, clone, MCP)
- Five-layer table with loading order
- Modifier system quick reference
- Named metrics summary table
- Worked scenarios directory reference
- Contribution guide

### Confirmed present — `core/multi-agent-coordination.md`

Existing file confirmed at 543 lines after additions:
  Section 1: Context window management with file size reference
  Section 2: Session state management
  Section 3: Multi-sport routing with Python router pattern
  Section 4: Handling conflicting signals (hierarchy: macro > critical flags > liquidity > multiply)
  Section 5: Edge cases (8 total)
  Section 6: Calibration and improvement over time
  Section 7 (new): Production deployment patterns, 72h chain, deployment checklist
### Added — `core/context-window-management.md`

Complete context window management guide for agents and developers:
- Token budget estimates per file category (all 5 layers quantified)
- Minimum viable loading sets for 5 use cases: domain query, pre-match prediction,
  fan token signal, commercial brief, DeFi check — each with exact file lists
- Progressive loading strategy for multi-query sessions
- File priority ranking for when context pressure forces fewer loads
- Token-saving techniques: numbers over prose, conditional loading with code example,
  summary mode pattern for reference files
- Context window budget by model: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama,
  Mistral, local models — with recommended use cases for each
- Overflow recovery protocol: what to preserve, what to drop, restart from summary

### Added — `examples/testing/testing-scenarios.md`

5 forward-looking validation playbooks for developers to verify integrations:
- T1: Football pre-match rivalry with congestion (derby modifier + Tier 2 congestion)
- T2: MMA weigh-in miss (severe weight cut modifier + title cannot change hands)
- T3: Fan token with DeFi liquidity constraint (liquidity_critical overrides HIGH signal)
- T4: Cricket DLS mid-match event (pre-match analysis superseded; new output object)
- T5: Macro override — crypto bear market (BTC 200-day MA check; ×0.75 modifier)

Each scenario includes: agent inputs, complete expected reasoning chain, expected
output fields, and a 7-point pass criteria checklist. Integration health scoring:
35/35 = production ready; common failure patterns documented.

## [2.8.0] — 2026-04-02 — Platform layer: API contracts + integration registry

### Purpose

The platform layer formalises how SportMind's intelligence is accessed — not what
it contains. SportMind's sole purpose remains unchanged: open sports intelligence
for AI agents and developers. The platform layer makes that intelligence reliable,
composable, and buildable-upon while maintaining full open access and MIT licensing.

### Added — `platform/` directory (3 new files)

**`platform/platform-overview.md`**
- Defines the platform layer's purpose: adding reliability and composability without
  changing the intelligence or restricting access
- Documents what changes and what doesn't: same five layers, same MIT license, same
  open community model — plus formal contracts and integration patterns
- Division of responsibility: data providers provide base_score; SportMind reasons
  around it. This division never changes regardless of who the data partner is.
- Three usage modes: Library (unchanged, always works), Contract (new formal calls),
  Integrated (data partner + SportMind combined)
- Open intelligence guarantee: no paid tiers, no restricted API, everything MIT

**`platform/api-contracts.md`**

Formal skill call specifications for all SportMind skill types:

Modifier contracts:
- `modifier.athlete`: Composite athlete modifier; guaranteed fields: modifiers_applied,
  signal (base + adjusted), flags (injury_warning, lineup_unconfirmed, congestion_warning)
- `modifier.macro`: Active macro event check; returns macro_context with crypto_cycle_phase
- `modifier.defi`: Pre-execution liquidity check; returns flags.liquidity_warning/critical +
  defi_context; neutral default (conservative) when pool data unavailable

Signal contracts:
- `signal.full`: Complete five-layer analysis in one call; execution order documented;
  all five layers load in sequence; returns full confidence output schema
- `signal.domain`: Sport domain context only; minimum viable call

Intelligence contracts:
- `intelligence.partnership`: PHS assessment with all five indicators + VSI;
  returns partnership_context with phase_label and recommended_layer3_weight
- `intelligence.lifecycle`: Token lifecycle phase identification
- `intelligence.validator`: VSI computation for validator clubs
- `intelligence.commercial`: Full commercial brief (Layer 3 chain)

Versioning system:
- Current: v1.0 (initial formalisation); v1.1 (defi_context additions, backward compatible)
- v1.x = additive only; always backward compatible
- v2.0 = breaking changes only with 6-month deprecation notice
- How agents declare version; how to detect schema upgrades

Standard error response format:
- Every error includes: code, message, agent_action (what the agent should do next),
  fallback_applied, fallback_description
- 9 error codes documented: UNKNOWN_SPORT, UNKNOWN_PLAYER, NO_UPCOMING_EVENT,
  TOKEN_NOT_FOUND, DATA_STALE, INSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT, MACRO_DATA_UNAVAILABLE,
  SCHEMA_VERSION_MISMATCH, LAYER_UNAVAILABLE
- Principle: errors never leave an agent in an ambiguous state

Generic integration pattern:
- Any data platform provides base_score; SportMind enriches it; agent acts on result
- The base_score is always external. The reasoning is always SportMind.

**`platform/integration-partners.md`**

Registry of how external systems connect to SportMind:

Partner 1 — FanTokenIntel (primary signal partner):
- What FTI provides: base_score, whale_flows, sell_ratio_brackets, prematch_alpha,
  match_results, sports_calendar, historical_patterns
- What SportMind provides: athlete modifier, domain context, competition weighting,
  macro overlay, lifecycle phase, DeFi liquidity check
- Full mapping table: each FTI tool → SportMind skill → what SportMind adds
- Complete Python integration code
- Autopilot template: sportmind_athlete_aware_matchday (JSON config)

Partner 2 — Chiliz / Socios (blockchain infrastructure):
- On-chain data sources; which Layer 3 skills consume which data
- Developer notes on open access vs proprietary data

Partner 3 — Azuro (prediction market protocol):
- Pool TVL → defi_context integration; LP position sizing with SportMind modifier
- Integration pattern for Azuro builders

Partner 4 — Sports data providers (Opta / Stats Perform / Sportradar):
- How licensed data feeds into Layer 2 athlete modifiers
- Notes on free alternatives (FBref) for prototyping vs production

Partner 5 — DeFi data providers (DeFiLlama / GeckoTerminal):
- How pool data feeds into modifier.defi and defi_context

Partner 6 — LLM providers:
- SportMind is LLM-agnostic; no provider-specific dependencies
- Context window guidance per model

Adding new integration partners: open PR process; what to include; what we don't add

### Updated — `core/confidence-output-schema.md`

- Full versioning changelog table added: v1.0 (initial), v1.1 (defi additions), future 2.0
- v1.0 → v1.1 migration guide: what's new, migration required (no), how to consume new fields
- Schema validation Python function updated: works for both v1.0 and v1.1
- Platform contract reference section added at bottom

### Updated — `sportmind-overview.md`

- `platform/` directory added to structure tree with descriptions
- Compatible platforms section restructured as table showing role of each platform;
  references platform/integration-partners.md and platform/api-contracts.md
- v2.8.0 added to roadmap

### Updated — `llms.txt`

- Version 2.7.0 → 2.8.0
- Platform files added to core reference table
- Compatible platforms section updated to show division of responsibility

---

## [2.9.0] — 2026-04-02 — Pre-v3.0 gap fixes + live signals specification

### Gap fixes

**Gap 1 — `GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md`:**
- Tier 2 section rewrote: "New athlete intelligence skills" changed to "Improvements
  to existing athlete skills" — all 28 complete L1 sports now have L2 coverage
- motogp and afl removed from "skills that don't yet exist" (both complete since v2.6.0)
- v2.6.0 completion note added listing all 10 new athlete skills added in that version

**Gap 2 — `core/multi-agent-coordination.md`:**
- Opening section updated to document two usage modes: Library (load files into context)
  vs Contract (call skill interfaces via platform/api-contracts.md)
- Explicit recommendation: Contract mode is preferred for multi-agent production systems

**Gap 3 — `agent-prompts/agent-prompts.md`:**
- Prompt 9 added: World Cup 2026 agent — national team tokens, NCSI spillover,
  WC2026 signal calendar (pre-tournament → group stage → knockouts → final),
  host nation NCSI premium (×1.25), early elimination signal (−20 to −35% club token)

**Gap 4 — `agent-prompts/agent-prompts.md`:**
- "Using platform contracts instead of file loading" section added at end
- Maps each prompt to its contract equivalent (Prompt 1 → signal.full football, etc.)
- References platform/api-contracts.md and platform/integration-partners.md

### Added — `platform/live-signals.md`

The foundation of SportMind's self-updating architecture. Defines the boundary between
static intelligence (read from skill files, updated by community) and live inputs
(fetched at query time from external sources).

Six live signal categories:
1. Macro state: BTC vs 200-day MA → macro_modifier; active geopolitical/health events
2. On-chain: Holder count trend (HCT), token velocity (TVI), utility event frequency (UEF)
3. DeFi/liquidity: Pool TVL, slippage estimation, LP activity signals
4. Athlete/team: Official lineup, injury designations, fixture congestion (date arithmetic)
5. Weather: Venue forecast for outdoor sports (by sport sensitivity hierarchy)
6. Prediction markets: Pool TVL conviction check; LP activity in Azuro/Polymarket

Three monitoring patterns:
- Continuous (4–6h): Macro state (BTC/CHZ prices) → shared session state
- Session (per decision): On-chain and liquidity signals → decision-time API calls
- Event (T-24h, T-3h, T-60min): Lineup, injury, weather → event-specific webhooks

Self-update signal triggers: What patterns indicate a skill file needs human review
(format changes, new partnerships, regulatory changes). Distinguishes between:
  Facts (can be detected automatically) vs Intelligence (requires human judgment)

Developer integration: Python code example fetching all live signals before analysis

v3.0 alignment: live-signals.md enables all four v3.0 roadmap items
(macro monitoring alerts, real-time updates, SportMind score, skill registry API)

### Updated — `sportmind-overview.md`

- NBATIS (NBA Token Impact Score) and CricTIS (Cricket Token Impact Score) added
  to Named Metrics Reference table — now 36 metrics total, aligned with glossary
- v2.9.0 added to roadmap

### Updated — `llms.txt` 

- Version 2.8.0 → 2.9.0
- platform/live-signals.md added to core reference table

---

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-02 — Platform, intelligence, and community infrastructure

SportMind v3.0 completes the shift from an intelligence library to a platform
that agents and developers can build on reliably. All seven roadmap items delivered.
The sole purpose remains unchanged: open sports intelligence for AI agents and developers.

### Added — `core/sportmind-score.md` (SportMind Score)

Unified cross-sport confidence metric (SMS) answering: "How complete and reliable
is this analysis?" — comparable across all sports, tokens, and agent types.

Formula: SMS = (Layer_Coverage × 0.35) + (Data_Freshness × 0.25)
              + (Flag_Health × 0.25) + (Modifier_Confidence × 0.15)

SMS tiers: HIGH_QUALITY (80+) | GOOD (60-79) | PARTIAL (40-59) |
           INCOMPLETE (20-39) | INSUFFICIENT (<20)

Combined decision matrix: adjusted_score HIGH + SMS LOW → WAIT (analysis incomplete
before acting); adjusted_score HIGH + SMS HIGH → full entry. The SMS tells agents
whether to trust the adjusted_score.

Python helper function, integration with platform contracts, cross-sport
comparability examples, and JSON schema object included.

### Added — `platform/skill-registry.md` (Skill Registry)

Queryable catalogue of all SportMind skills with standardised metadata.

Complete skill ID reference for all 5 layers:
- 28 stable L1 domain skills + 14 stub skill IDs
- 29 L2 athlete skill IDs with primary modifier variable per sport
- 21 L3 fan token skill IDs with contract mapping
- 35 L4 market file IDs with tier and key insight
- 8 L5 macro skill IDs with key signal

Registry query patterns (Python): get_skills_for_sport, get_skills_by_type,
MINIMUM_VIABLE_SETS dictionary for 5 use cases

Contributor metadata standard: YAML block for skill files with skill_id, type,
sport, tier, status, layers, key_metrics, contract, version

### Added — `core/calibration-framework.md` (ML-Calibrated Modifier Weights)

Infrastructure for improving modifier accuracy through outcome tracking.

Outcome tracking schema: JSON record linking SportMind prediction to actual result
Three accuracy dimensions: direction accuracy (≥70% target), magnitude calibration
(mean absolute error < 0.08 target), confidence tier calibration (tier-specific win rates)

Sport-specific calibration targets: 7 athlete modifier scenarios with current ranges,
accuracy targets, and minimum event thresholds for first recalibration

5-step calibration workflow: log → track → aggregate (monthly) → propose (quarterly)
→ community vote (70%+ consensus required) → merge

Calibration example: football athlete modifier position-specific breakdown after 500 events

Contribution guide: format, data privacy requirements, submission process

### Added — `platform/monitoring-alerts.md` + CI Workflows (Monitoring Alerts)

Alert specifications for automated macro monitoring and skill review detection.

6 alert specifications:
- MACRO_CRYPTO_CYCLE: BTC vs 200-day MA crossover (3-confirm rule); CHZ severe decline
- MACRO_GEOPOLITICAL: Keyword monitoring in Reuters/AP/BBC; geo-watch list 18 countries
- MACRO_ECONOMIC: GDP recession confirmation; inflation spike
- SKILL_REVIEW/COMPETITION_FORMAT: Competition structure changes
- SKILL_REVIEW/NEW_PARTNERSHIP: New Chiliz/Socios announcements
- SKILL_REVIEW/REGULATORY: India VDA, EU MiCA, UK FCA, US SEC/CFTC monitoring

Standard webhook format with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification; retry policy (5 attempts)

`platform/macro-state.json` — auto-updated lightweight JSON for fast session-start
macro check; agents read this instead of loading full macro files

`.github/workflows/macro-monitor.yml` — runs every 4 hours; checks BTC/CHZ thresholds;
updates macro-state.json; commits back to repo
`.github/workflows/skill-monitor.yml` — runs weekly; checks competition sources for
format changes; creates GitHub issues for stale skills

### Added — `i18n/` Multi-language Support

Framework for community-translated skill files.

`i18n/README.md` — language framework; available languages table; how to use translated
skills (Python fallback pattern); translation contribution guide

Spanish starter skills (beta):
- `i18n/es/sports/football/sport-domain-football.md` — Season calendar, event hierarchy
- `i18n/es/sports/mma/sport-domain-mma.md` — Fight week, weigh-in signal

Portuguese starter skill (beta):
- `i18n/pt/sports/football/sport-domain-football.md` — With Brazilian market context
  (Brasileirão, Copa Libertadores, Brazilian token holder community note)

All translations preserve English field names, metrics, code, and numerical values.
Leaderboard incentive: +8 points per skill per language on merge.

### Added — `community/` (Community Leaderboard)

`community/leaderboard.md` — 5-tier system (New → SportMind Expert) with point
thresholds, badges, and privileges. Contribution Score formula: Skill Quality (40%)
+ Prediction Accuracy (40%) + Community Impact (20%). Submission process.

`community/accuracy-tracking.md` — Prediction accuracy methodology: direction
accuracy, measurement windows by signal type, outcome record format (JSON), submission
path to community/calibration-data/

### Updated — `core/confidence-output-schema.md` (v1.2)

- sportmind_score object added to schema: sms score, sms_tier, components breakdown,
  layers_loaded, analysis_completeness
- Schema changelog updated: v1.2 entry added (backward compatible, new object only)

### Updated — `sportmind-overview.md`

- Structure tree updated: community/, i18n/, new core and platform files
- v3.0 roadmap items marked ✅; v3.1 roadmap added
- Overview lines: 1,260

### Updated — `llms.txt` → v3.0.0

- Version 2.9.0 → 3.0.0
- All 9 new files added to core reference table

---

**SportMind v3.0 — complete.**
All seven roadmap items delivered. 220+ files. Validator: 0 errors.
The library is a platform. The platform serves open intelligence.
The intelligence serves AI agents and developers.


---

## [3.0.1] — 2026-04-02 — Post-release consistency fixes

Six issues identified and resolved before moving to v3.1.

**`README.md` (3 fixes):**
- Badge updated: `skills-185+` → `skills-211+` (accurate total file count)
- Agent output schema updated to v1.2: added `sportmind_score` object (SMS, tier,
  layers_loaded) and `defi_context` object (primary_venue, pool_tvl_usd,
  estimated_slippage_pct, lp_activity_signal) — both added in v2.6.0/v3.0 but
  missing from README example
- "Start here" table expanded from 9 to 15 entries: added `platform/api-contracts.md`,
  `platform/integration-partners.md`, `core/sportmind-score.md`,
  `core/context-window-management.md`, `examples/testing/testing-scenarios.md`,
  `platform/skill-registry.md`; "Compatible frameworks" section updated to document
  contract mode and integration partners

**`community/calibration-data/` (1 fix):**
- Directory created with README.md documenting: directory structure by sport/year/month,
  submission instructions, full outcome_record JSON schema, data quality requirements,
  and data privacy standards
- Referenced by calibration-framework.md, accuracy-tracking.md, and leaderboard.md
  but was missing from filesystem

**`platform/monitoring-sources.json` (1 fix):**
- Created: 8 competition format sources (UEFA, FIFA, ICC, NBA, F1, UFC, EHF, NRL),
  2 partnership sources (Socios fan token list, Chiliz announcements), 2 regulatory
  sources (SEBI India, EU MiCA) — each with sport, skills_affected, check_frequency,
  stale_threshold_days, and monitor_for fields
- Referenced by skill-monitor.yml CI workflow but was missing from filesystem

**`scripts/` — 4 monitoring scripts (1 fix):**
- `check_macro_signals.py` — BTC vs 200-day MA checker: CoinGecko API integration,
  3-consecutive-confirm logic to prevent false alerts, phase determination
  (BULL/NEUTRAL/BEAR/EXTREME_BEAR), macro_modifier calculation, macro-state.json update,
  webhook delivery with HMAC alert payload
- `update_macro_state.py` — macro-state.json timestamp updater for CI post-check
- `check_skill_freshness.py` — multi-source freshness monitor: loads monitoring-sources.json,
  checks each source, creates GitHub issues for stale skills (requires GITHUB_TOKEN),
  extensible to any monitoring source
- `check_token_partnerships.py` — Socios/Chiliz partnership monitor: loads skill registry,
  detects sports with tokens but no bridge skill, reports undocumented partnerships
- All four scripts: full CLI argument parsing, graceful handling of missing dependencies,
  clear NOTE comments identifying production integration requirements, exit codes for CI

## [3.1.0] — 2026-04-02 — Calibration data, i18n expansion, skill registry API

### Added — Calibration data infrastructure

**`community/calibration-data/` — 5 seed outcome records:**

Seed records derived from worked scenarios, demonstrating the outcome record format
and validating key SportMind modifier signals against real historical events:

- `football/2023/05/ucl-final-2023-06-10-outcome.json` — Man City 1-0 Inter UCL Final;
  narrative_modifier (+8% treble narrative) validated; $CITY token +14.2% post-match;
  direction correct; modifier_magnitude_error 0.04

- `mma/2022/11/ufc-281-2022-11-12-outcome.json` — Pereira KO Adesanya Round 5;
  macro_modifier (×0.55 FTX extreme bear) validated; token fell 8.4% despite correct
  fight prediction; key validation: prediction markets and token signals must be
  treated separately during extreme bear conditions

- `basketball/2023/02/nba-kd-trade-2023-02-09-outcome.json` — Kevin Durant trade
  Brooklyn→Phoenix; Woj verification as entry trigger validated; Tier 1 player trade
  signal confirmed; macro bear (×0.82) correctly applied to token component

- `cricket/2023/05/ipl-qualifier-1-2023-05-23-outcome.json` — CSK vs MI IPL 2023;
  dew_modifier validated (toss + dew = batting second advantage); DLS event mid-match
  confirmed: pre-match analysis superseded = new output object required

- `rugby-league/2023/07/state-of-origin-g3-2023-07-12-outcome.json` — NSW vs QLD
  Origin G3 decider; rivalry_form_discount (40% form compression) validated; LOW
  confidence (53.2) as correct tier for Tier 1 rivalries validated; downstream NRL
  congestion signal confirmed as higher-value than Origin pick itself

Calibration summary across 5 seed records: direction accuracy 100% (small sample);
all modifier types correctly showing INSUFFICIENT_DATA pending 50–200+ events.

**`scripts/calibration_aggregate.py`:**
Full calibration pipeline script. Loads all outcome records from calibration-data/,
calculates direction accuracy by sport and confidence tier, modifier accuracy per
modifier type with calibration status vs targets, generates JSON reports.
CLI flags: --sport, --all, --report, --output. Handles seed records gracefully.

  Dream11 200M+ users as digital readiness evidence

All translations include culturally specific market context not present in English
originals. Field names, metrics, code, and numerical values remain in English per
translation standards. Each starter clearly marks where community contributors should
expand to full translation.

i18n/README.md updated: French, Arabic, Hindi status changed from "Planned" to "Beta".

### Added — Skill registry API

**`scripts/skill_registry_api.py`:**

## [3.3.0] — 2026-04-02 — Hosted SportMind Skills API

### The core addition

**`scripts/sportmind_api.py` — The hosted SportMind Skills API**

The completion of the platform layer. Serves all 159 SportMind skill files as
on-demand content, removing the final barrier between SportMind's intelligence
and the agents that need it. Developers call the API instead of managing files.

**What it does:**
- Serves skill content on demand: `GET /skills/{id}/content` returns the full markdown
- Delivers complete intelligence stacks: `GET /stack?use_case=fan_token_tier1&sport=football`
  returns all skills in the correct loading order, ready for direct agent injection
- Serves current macro state: `GET /macro-state` from `platform/macro-state.json`
- Exports static JSON for GitHub Pages: `--export-github-pages ./docs/api`
- All endpoints return CORS-enabled JSON with X-SportMind-Version header

**File map: 159 skills mapped:**
  - 42 domain skills (28 complete + 14 stubs)
  - 29 athlete skills
  - 24 fan token skills + fantoken.why
  - 35 market skills
  - 8 macro skills
  - 16 core skills
  - 5 platform skills

**HTTP endpoints:**
```
GET /                      API info and endpoint directory
GET /health                Version, skill count, content file count
GET /skills                Full registry (metadata) with filter support
GET /skills?sport=football Filter by sport
GET /skills?type=domain    Filter by type (domain/athlete/fantoken/macro/core/market)
GET /skills/{id}           Single skill metadata with content_endpoint hint
GET /skills/{id}/content   Full skill content (markdown) — primary delivery endpoint
GET /skills/mvs/{use_case} MVS metadata
GET /skills/mvs/{use_case}/content  Full MVS content stack
GET /stack?use_case=&sport= Complete intelligence stack — one call for agent injection
GET /macro-state           Current BTC cycle phase, active events, macro_modifier
```

**CLI tools:**
```bash
python scripts/sportmind_api.py --serve --port 8080       # HTTP server
python scripts/sportmind_api.py --content domain.football # Single skill content
python scripts/sportmind_api.py --stack fan_token_tier1 --sport football  # Full stack
python scripts/sportmind_api.py --export-github-pages ./docs/api  # Static export
python scripts/sportmind_api.py --stats                   # Library statistics
python scripts/sportmind_api.py --list-ids                # All 159 skill IDs
```

**Why this matters for SportMind's objective:**
The library has always been the right intelligence. The API is what makes that
intelligence accessible to agents at query time rather than at setup time.
An agent using the API gets current intelligence (macro-state updated every 4h);
an agent using a cloned repo gets a snapshot. The gap is now closed.

### Added — `.github/workflows/publish-api.yml`

GitHub Actions workflow that auto-deploys the Skills API to GitHub Pages on every
push touching skill files, athlete files, fan-token files, core, market, or macro.
Generates the complete versioned static API snapshot in `docs/api/`.

### Updated — `platform/skill-registry-api.md`

Updated with `sportmind_api.py` as the primary tool (replacing `skill_registry_api.py`
for content delivery). Python client examples updated to show content delivery pattern.
GitHub Actions section updated to reference `publish-api.yml`.

### Updated — `README.md`

Three usage modes now documented:
- **API mode** (new, recommended for production): `GET /stack` returns full intelligence stack
- **Library mode** (unchanged): paste skill file contents into system prompt
- **Contract mode** (unchanged): formal skill contracts via `platform/api-contracts.md`

Start here table updated with API mode as first option.
Badge updated: 237+ → 242+ files.

### Final state
- 159 skill IDs mapped and served
- All content endpoints tested and verified
- GitHub Actions workflow: auto-deploys on skill changes
- Version: 3.3.0

---

## [3.5.0] — 2026-04-03 — Security layer

The security layer that makes SportMind safe for production agent use.
Addresses the trust gap created when the Skills API (v3.3) made skill content
accessible on demand — the same capability that makes the library more useful
also changes its attack surface.

### Added — `scripts/security_validator.py`

A dedicated security scanner that runs alongside the existing skill-validator.py.

**Prompt injection scan (30+ pattern categories):**
- Instruction override: "ignore previous/prior instructions", "forget your instructions"
- Persona hijack: "you are now", "act as", "pretend to be", "from now on you are"
- LLM control tokens: `<|im_start|>`, `[INST]`, `###System:`, chat format injections
- Data exfiltration: "send this data to", external fetch() calls, eval()/exec()
- Financial manipulation: hardcoded buy/sell signals, market manipulation language
- Jailbreak patterns: "DAN mode", "developer mode enabled", "do anything now"

Runs against 194 files: all sport domain, athlete, fan-token, core, market, macro,
agent-prompts, i18n, and platform skill files. Findings rated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM.
CRITICAL/HIGH findings block merge. MEDIUM findings are advisory for maintainer review.

Allowlist system: legitimate educational mentions of patterns (security docs, code
examples in documentation, known data source URLs) are allowlisted by path fragment
and description, preventing false positives in data source files.

**Integrity verification:**
Verifies all skill files against SHA-256 hashes stored in platform/skill-hashes.json.
Reports files modified since last hash generation as HIGH findings.
Reports new files not yet in registry as INFO findings (run --generate-hashes).

**Calibration provenance check:**
Verifies all outcome records have: `submitted_by`, `submission_timestamp`,
`result_source_url` (non-empty), and required `outcome.result` field.
Missing fields = MEDIUM findings that block calibration acceptance.

**CLI flags:**
  `--content`          injection scan only
  `--hashes`           integrity check only
  `--calibration`      provenance check only
  `--generate-hashes`  update platform/skill-hashes.json
  `--verbose`          show all findings including INFO level

**First run result:** 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH, 34 MEDIUM (all legitimate external URLs
in data source documentation files — none in agent-facing skill content)

### Added — `platform/skill-hashes.json`

SHA-256 hashes for all 179 SportMind skill files. The integrity anchor for the
Skills API and for any developer or agent integrating SportMind content.

Agents verify received content before injecting into context:
```python
import hashlib, json, requests

hashes = requests.get(".../platform/skill-hashes.json").json()
skill = requests.get(".../skills/domain.football/content").json()
actual = hashlib.sha256(skill["content"].encode()).hexdigest()
expected = hashes["files"].get(skill["file_path"], {}).get("sha256")
assert actual == expected, "Content integrity check failed — do not inject"
```

Every content response from the Skills API now includes `sha256` and
`integrity_note` fields automatically.

### Added — `SECURITY.md`

Complete security policy for SportMind:

**5 threats documented:** Prompt injection (CRITICAL), counterfeit API endpoint (HIGH),
calibration data poisoning (MEDIUM), subtly biased content (MEDIUM),
skill registry manipulation (LOW)

**Security infrastructure:** Automated scanning, integrity hashing, calibration
provenance, official source declarations

**Responsible disclosure:** Private reporting process, 24h acknowledge / 48h confirm
/ 48h remove / 7d patch SLA, public post-mortem policy, permanent block for
malicious contributors

**4-tier trust model:** Core maintainers → Verified contributors → Community →
Unverified, with review requirements and API exposure policy per tier

**Security checklists:** One for skill contributors (7 items), one for developers
and agents using SportMind (6 items)

### Added — `.github/workflows/security-check.yml`

CI workflow running on every PR that touches skill files:
- Injection scan (CRITICAL/HIGH blocks merge)
- Integrity verification against skill-hashes.json
- Calibration provenance check
- Auto-updates skill-hashes.json on merge to main

### Updated — `scripts/sportmind_api.py` (v3.5)

Every `/skills/{id}/content` response now includes:
  `sha256`: SHA-256 hash of the returned content
  `integrity_note`: instructions for verifying against skill-hashes.json

### Updated — All 7 calibration records

All seed records backfilled with provenance fields:
  `submitted_by`: "sportmind-core"
  `submission_timestamp`: "2026-04-02T00:00:00Z"
  `data_quality`: {source_tier, manually_verified, official_result_confirmed}

### Updated — `sportmind-overview.md`, `llms.txt` → v3.5.0

`community/calibration-data/calibration-methodology-report-v3.6.md` — Human-readable
methodology report with full interpretation:
- 100% direction accuracy (7/7) — informational; seed records from known outcomes
- All modifiers correctly INSUFFICIENT_DATA — minimum thresholds not reached
- Key insight 1: macro override (UFC 281 + FTX) is the library's most complex signal
  interaction; it behaved correctly — token fell despite correct fight prediction
- Key insight 2: downstream congestion (State of Origin → NRL clubs) more valuable
  than primary result signal
- Key insight 3: narrative_active in championship closeout = positive amplifier
  for favoured team, not a caution signal
- Next milestone: 50 community records for dew_modifier and rivalry_form_discount
  (lowest thresholds; cricket and rugby league target sports)

## [3.8.0] — 2026-04-03 — Application blueprints

### Added — `examples/applications/` (7 files: README + 6 blueprints)

Six fully specified application blueprints showing developers exactly what to build
with SportMind intelligence and exactly which skills to use. Each blueprint includes:
the problem solved, target users, the precise SportMind skill stack, integration code
examples, output format, and a full agent system prompt.

**App 1 — Decentralised Sports Prediction Finance**
(`examples/applications/app-01-defi-prediction-market.md`)
A SportMind + Azuro prediction market that publishes structured intelligence before
market open. SMS-gated signal publication (SMS < 60 = INSUFFICIENT_DATA, not published).
Full DeFi execution flow (TVL check → slippage estimate → Azuro placement). Signal
separation documented: prediction market signal ≠ fan token signal (UFC 281 case study).
Chiliz Chain on-chain publication code example. Regulatory note.

**App 2 — Fan Token Portfolio Intelligence**
(`examples/applications/app-02-portfolio-intelligence.md`)
Contextual explanation for fan token holders — explaining portfolio movements, surfacing
upcoming signal events, and providing lifecycle-aware reasoning. HAS/TVI on-chain
baseline. NCSI spillover narrative for national team events. Lifecycle phase awareness
(Phase 2 vs Phase 3 price moves have different interpretations). Push notification
integration for upcoming signal events. Manchester City post-UCL-exit example.

**App 3 — Athlete Commercial Intelligence Platform**
(`examples/applications/app-03-athlete-commercial.md`)
Full commercial brief workflow for sports agents, clubs, and brands. Full 9-skill
commercial stack (PI → DTS/TAI/PS → SHS/AGI → AELS → APS → TVS/DLVS → ABS → AFS).
Complete commercial brief format with all metrics, APS portability assessment, ABS
calculation with component breakdown, top-3 sponsorship recommendations with estimated
market rates, token-native activation ideas. APS is explicitly positioned as the metric
no existing commercial sports tool provides.

**App 4 — Sports Brand Token Strategy Tool**
(`examples/applications/app-04-brand-token-strategy.md`)
Pre-launch due diligence for clubs evaluating fan token partnership. Sport tier
assessment → lifecycle LTUI modelling (optimistic/base/pessimistic) → PHS projection
at 12 months → regulatory scan by primary market → timing recommendation. Full due
diligence report format. Mid-tier domestic football club example with complete report.

**App 5 — World Cup 2026 Intelligence Dashboard**
(`examples/applications/app-05-world-cup-dashboard.md`)
Live intelligence for the FIFA World Cup 2026 tournament. Four components: NCSI live
tracker (per-match, per-player club spillover), tournament signal calendar (5 phases
from qualification through Final), club token impact monitor (post-match, within 1h),
US market unlock module (tracking potential Tier 2→1 upgrade catalysts in USA/Canada/
Mexico host markets).

**App 6 — Sports GameFi Intelligence Layer**
(`examples/applications/app-06-gamefi-layer.md`)
On-chain sports game mechanics powered by SportMind SMS. Four mechanics: SMS-weighted
scoring (correct pick at SMS 80+ = 15pts vs 10pts at SMS <60), flag-aware pick locking
(lineup_unconfirmed = 50% weight until confirmed), multi-sport tournament with SMS
rankings as tiebreaker, macro state game events (bear market triggers prize reduction
and macro-knowledge bonus). On-chain pick integrity via SHA-256 skill hash signature.

### Updated — `sportmind-overview.md`
- Application blueprints table added to developer tooling section
- v3.8 roadmap marked ✅; v3.9 defined

### Updated — `llms.txt` → v3.8.0
### Updated — `scripts/sportmind_api.py` → v3.8
### Updated — `platform/skill-hashes.json` → regenerated

---

## [3.9.0] — 2026-04-03 — SportFi Kit integration

### Added — Partner 7: SportFi Kit (`platform/integration-partners.md`)

Full integration documentation for SportFi Kit — a React/TypeScript developer toolkit
for building fan engagement dApps on the Chiliz Chain.

**What SportFi Kit is:**
SportFi Kit is an MIT-licensed open-source development suite described as "the missing
bridge between the Socios.com ecosystem and the decentralised web." It provides React
components/hooks for fan token interactions, Solidity smart contracts for P2P wagering
on Chiliz Chain, automatic environment detection for Socios.com Wallet Browser and
Telegram Mini Apps, CLI scaffolding for new sports dApps, and token-gating primitives.
Tech stack: TypeScript (80%), Solidity (3%), React + Tailwind, npm monorepo.
Repository: github.com/AltcoinDaddy/Sportfi-kit

**Layer separation (no conflicts):**
SportFi Kit operates at the application/UI/contract layer.
SportMind operates at the intelligence/reasoning layer.
Neither overlaps with the other. Both are MIT licensed. No commercial agreement
required. A developer can use either independently or both together.

**What SportFi Kit provides to SportMind applications:**
Token-gating (check fan token holdings before granting access), P2P wagering contracts
on Chiliz Chain (the settlement layer for App 1's DeFi prediction market), Socios Wallet
and Telegram Mini App environment detection (reaches users inside Socios app), CLI
scaffolding for rapid dApp creation.

**What SportMind provides to SportFi Kit applications:**
Pre-match intelligence (adjusted_score + SMS) for wagering contracts, portfolio
context (lifecycle phase, NCSI narrative, upcoming signal calendar) for token-gated
experiences, macro state for context-aware UI decisions, NCSI + FTIS for live
engagement displays, commercial intelligence (ABS, APS, AELS) for athlete features.

**Integration code pattern:** Complete TypeScript example showing useSportMind() hook
calling Skills API, SMS-gated wager button, flag-aware UI state, 7-application mapping
table showing SportFi Kit + SportMind split per blueprint.

### Added — App 7: SportFi Kit + SportMind Full-Stack Blueprint
(`examples/applications/app-07-sportfi-kit-integration.md`)

Complete React/TypeScript integration reference for Chiliz Chain dApps:
- useSportMind() custom React hook: fetches full intelligence stack + macro state,
  parses into clean signal object (sms, smsTier, adjustedScore, direction, flags,
  canEnter, shouldWait), 4-hour macro refresh interval
- PredictionWidget component: token-gated (SportFi Kit) + intelligence-powered
  (SportMind), SMS-gated wager button with on-chain signal hash for integrity
- PortfolioIntelligence component: fan token portfolio from SportFi Kit wallet hook,
  per-token intelligence panel from SportMind commercial brief stack
- Environment-aware MacroBanner: SportFi Kit environment detection (Socios/Telegram)
  + SportMind macro state — compact in-app display vs full browser display
- Integrity verification utility: verifies skill content SHA-256 against
  platform/skill-hashes.json before injecting into agent context
- Vercel deployment config matching SportFi Kit's existing deployment pattern

### Updated — `examples/applications/README.md`

Application blueprints table and file listing updated: 6 → 7 blueprints.

### Updated — `sportmind-overview.md`, `llms.txt` → v3.9.0, API v3.9

---

## [3.10.0] — 2026-04-04 — MCP server, temporal awareness, security expansion, i18n deepening

### Added — `platform/sportmind-mcp-server.md`

Full MCP (Model Context Protocol) server specification for SportMind. Moves from
static context injection to dynamic on-demand intelligence retrieval.

Four tools defined with complete JSON schemas and example request/response pairs:
- `sportmind_signal`: Generate pre-match intelligence signal (adjusted_score, SMS,
  flags, reasoning summary); `include_defi_context` option
- `sportmind_macro`: Get current macro state (crypto cycle phase, macro_modifier,
  active events); always call before fan token analysis
- `sportmind_stack`: Load full intelligence stack in correct loading order with
  optional `compressed` mode (500-char summaries, ~70% token cost reduction)
- `sportmind_verify`: Verify skill content SHA-256 integrity against skill-hashes.json

Integration patterns documented:
  Claude Desktop config (claude_desktop_config.json with stdio transport)
  Anthropic API remote integration (mcp_servers parameter with HTTP/SSE)
  Tool call sequencing rule: macro → signal/stack → verify (optional)
  Relationship to Skills API: MCP for agent frameworks, Skills API for web apps

### Added — `scripts/sportmind_mcp.py`

Working MCP server implementation (234 lines, Python). Implements all 4 tools,
SMS computation from skill file coverage, freshness notes, macro state loading,
integrity verification against skill-hashes.json. Supports stdio transport
(Claude Desktop). Install: `pip install mcp --break-system-packages`

### Added — `core/temporal-awareness.md`

Six-tier information freshness taxonomy — the missing piece for production deployments.

| Tier | Type | Expires | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Permanent | Never | Cricket dew factor model, confidence schema |
| 1 | Slow | 90 days | Market tier assessments, regulatory summaries |
| 2 | Moderate | 1-4 weeks | Form scores, league standings, career stage |
| 3 | Daily | 4-8 hours | Macro state, injury lists, HAS trends |
| 4 | Match-day | T-2h | Lineups, weather, weigh-ins, pitching rotation |
| 5 | Live | Minutes | DeFi TVL, token price, in-play events |

Staleness formulas: form_modifier_reliability = 1.00 - (days/28 × 0.15) at 4+ weeks.
The SportMind boundary: SportMind provides intelligence models (Tier 0-2), not live
data (Tier 5). Applications bridge the gap. Documented clearly with code examples.
Two production deployment patterns: scheduled macro refresh and MCP freshness checking.

### Updated — `SECURITY.md` (274 → 434 lines)

Threat 6 — Prompt theft (MEDIUM):
  System prompt protection rules for deployed agents (5 rules, copy-paste ready)
  MCP tool mode as more secure alternative: skill content fetched on demand rather
  than resident in system prompt means there is nothing to extract
  Note on open-source SportMind: core content is publicly available; primary concern
  is protecting application-specific customisations

Threat 7 — Meta-prompt injection (MEDIUM):
  Scope enforcement rules (5 rules, copy-paste ready for system prompts)
  Query classification Python guard with SCOPE_VIOLATION_PATTERNS list
  Relationship to Threat 1: file-level injection caught by security_validator.py;
  query-level injection must be caught at runtime by the application
  
Developer checklist expanded: 7 → 9 items (added prompt theft and meta-injection)
Changelog section added to SECURITY.md for tracking security changes

### Updated — `i18n/hi/sports/cricket/` (141 → 266 lines)

Full IPL intelligence layer added:
  Franchise token readiness ranking: MI (5× champion, Reliance), CSK (Dhoni legacy),
  RCB (Kohli brand), KKR (SRK entertainment crossover) — commercial case per franchise
  IPL Signal Calendar: Auction (January), Season (March-May), Retention (October-November)
  with specific signal multipliers per event type
  India 2026 T20 World Cup hosting: documented as potential regulatory catalyst
  (SEBI clarity + India hosting = perfect IPL token launch window)

Dew factor by venue (new — specific to India):
  Wankhede (Mumbai): very high dew; Eden Gardens (Kolkata): high; 
  Chepauk (Chennai): low; Dubai: very high — venue-specific guidance

ICC Tournament Calendar: T20 WC (odd years), ODI WC, Asia Cup timing with
India-Pakistan guarantee clause

### Updated — `i18n/fr/sports/football/` (151 → 264 lines)

Ligue 1 commercial context added:
  18-club format (since 2023-24) with European qualification slots
  DAZN + beIN Sports + Canal+ broadcast context
  Club-by-club token readiness: PSG, OM, OL, Monaco, LOSC
  Relegation signal model for token lifecycle impact

PSG $PSG deep analysis:
  QSI ownership geopolitical context (Qatar-France diplomatic relations)
  ATM by position (star = 0.85-0.95, midfield = 0.55-0.70, defence = 0.40-0.55)
  PSG Handball halo documented (+3% at EHF Final4, +5% if CL winner)

NCSI Équipe de France:
  Euro 2028 (Netherlands/Germany), WC 2026 (USA/Canada/Mexico) projections
  France WC win scenario: +30-50% signal for tokens of clubs with French players

French regulatory context:
  ANJ (prediction markets), AMF/PSAN (crypto assets), MiCA (EU harmonisation)
  Note: fan tokens ≠ sports betting legally — distinct regulatory paths

### Updated — `sportmind-overview.md`
- Core count: 15 → 16 (temporal-awareness.md)
- Platform: sportmind-mcp-server.md added to platform layer table
- v3.10 roadmap marked ✅; v3.11 defined

### Updated — `llms.txt` → v3.10.0, `scripts/sportmind_api.py` → v3.10
### Updated — `platform/skill-hashes.json` regenerated

---

## [3.11.0] — 2026-04-04 — International football cycle, governance + scouting, agentic workflows, compressed skills

### Added — `market/international-football-cycle.md` (the centrepiece of v3.11)

The perpetual international football cycle model — SportMind's answer to the gap
identified in v3.10: the World Cup is one peak in a continuous cycle, not the end.

Three-tier NCSI hierarchy with precise weights for every competition type:
  Tier 1 (NCSI 1.00): World Cup, Euros (×1.10 for European clubs)
  Tier 2 (NCSI 0.45–0.80): Nations League, WC/Euro qualification, Copa América, AFCON
  Tier 3 (NCSI 0.10–0.25): Friendlies (with four specific high-value exceptions:
    injury comeback, squad selection signal, pre-tournament preparation, prestige fixture)

Post-tournament 4-phase transition model:
  Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Narrative completes — do not act on residual signal
  Phase 2 (Week 3-6): Transfer window peak — run APS for all token-connected clubs
  Phase 3 (July-Aug): Pre-season/league restart — club signals resume primacy
  Phase 4 (September+): Return to cycle — ×0.85 tournament fatigue modifier applied

Euro 2028 planning framework:
  Host: Netherlands + Germany; June-July 2028
  For European club tokens: equal signal weight to World Cup 2026
  Qualification begins September 2026 — immediately after World Cup ends
  Euro 2028 NCSI: ×1.10 vs World Cup for European club tokens (higher concentration)

International break protocol:
  10 windows per year; pre-break / during / post-break agent rules defined
  Key monitoring: star player injury (immediate negative), comeback (immediate positive),
  decisive qualification result (sustained directional signal)

### Updated — `market/world-cup-2026.md`

Post-tournament transition section added:
  Week-by-week guidance from final whistle to Euro 2028 qualification
  September 2026 dual-signal: post-WC recovery + first Euro 2028 qualifier simultaneously
  Reference to international-football-cycle.md for full model

### Added — `examples/applications/app-08-governance-intelligence.md`

Pre-vote commercial intelligence for fan token governance.
Vote types: player signing, commercial partnership, kit/branding.
Output: full governance brief with LTUI YES vs NO projection, risk flags,
APS for signing votes, PHS for partnership votes, AFS for sponsorship votes.
SportFi Kit integration: useGovernanceVote hook with signal hash for on-chain integrity.
Agent rules: "frame as intelligence context, not voting recommendation."

### Added — `examples/applications/app-09-talent-scouting.md`

Complete 7-section scouting intelligence report for sporting directors.
Sections: PI (on-pitch foundation), DTS/TAI/PS (trajectory + durability),
SHS/AGI/AELS (social + token engagement), APS/TVS/TSI (transfer assessment),
ABS (commercial synthesis), AFS (sponsorship categories), LTUI impact.

Post-tournament APS recalculation: World Cup/Euro standout performances shift
APS by 0.10-0.20 in 4 weeks — recalculate before each transfer window.
Transfer timing: pre-contract approach strategy for expiring contracts.

### Added — `examples/agentic-workflows/README.md`

Four reusable long-running workflow patterns with full Python implementation:

Pattern 1 — Continuous Portfolio Monitor:
  4-hour scheduled cycle; macro check → per-token analysis → alert detection;
  alert conditions: macro override, high-signal event < 48h, injury flag;
  autonomous vs escalation rules documented

Pattern 2 — Pre-Match Intelligence Chain:
  T-48h analysis (lineup_unconfirmed = True, 50% position size);
  T-2h update (lineup confirmed → full size; key player absent → full reload);
  never carry T-48h signal past T-2h without update

Pattern 3 — Tournament Tracker:
  Per-match NCSI calculation with stage multipliers (group=1.0, final=2.0);
  elimination signal: -0.05 to -0.18 depending on stage;
  tournament fatigue modifier for semi-finals/final;
  TournamentTracker class with squad_data initialisation and signal report

Pattern 4 — Transfer Window Monitor:
  Rumour tier → TSI mapping (Tier 1 journalist = 0.80, social media = 0.15);
  TSI >= 0.60 triggers APS recalculation;
  confirmation → final token impact report (selling club and buying club)

Human escalation principles: 5 escalate conditions, 4 autonomous conditions,
3 never-autonomous conditions (financial execution, governance votes, transfer offers).

### Added — `compressed/README.md`

10 compressed skill summaries (~1,070 tokens total vs ~32,000 full):
Football, cricket, basketball, MMA, F1, football token intel, macro state,
fan token lifecycle, DeFi liquidity, confidence output schema.
97% compression ratio. Use for monitoring; use full for decision-quality analysis.
Accessible via MCP: sportmind_stack(compressed=true)
Accessible via API: GET /stack?sport={sport}&compressed=true

### Updated — `sportmind-overview.md`
- Market count: 35 → 36 (international-football-cycle.md)
- Application blueprints: 7 → 9 (governance + talent scouting)
- Agentic workflows section added
- Compressed skills section added
- v3.11 roadmap marked ✅; v3.12 defined

### Updated — `llms.txt` → v3.11.0, `scripts/sportmind_api.py` → v3.11
### Updated — `platform/skill-hashes.json` regenerated

---

## [3.12.0] — 2026-04-04 — Manager intelligence, reasoning patterns, athlete financial intelligence, RWA/SportFi layer

### Added — `core/manager-intelligence.md`

Completes the people-layer of the library. Athletes have deep coverage. Officials
have officiating-intelligence. Managers now have a first-class intelligence model.

Manager Signal Index (MgSI): (Stability×0.35)+(Track_Record×0.30)+(System_Fit×0.20)+(Press_Conduct×0.15)

New manager effect model (quantified):
  Permanent appointment Match 1-3: ×1.10 | Match 4-7: ×1.04
  Caretaker Match 1-2: ×1.12 (crisis response) | Match 6+: ×0.93 drag

Sacking signal 5-stage progression:
  Stage 1 (media speculation) → Stage 2 (named sources) → Stage 3 (board statement)
  → Stage 4 (confirmed sacking) → Stage 5 (replacement named)
  Average Stage 1 → confirmed: 8-14 days. Token signal by stage documented.

Manager conduct intelligence: touchline card rate, fine history (3+ in 12 months = risk),
  player relationship signals, crisis escalation model

Sport-specific models: football (press conference language decoder, tactical system
  signals, tenure averages by club tier), rugby (coaching structure signals),
  basketball (NBA minutes distribution, EuroLeague cycle patterns)

Career record JSON schema for structured manager data

### Added — `core/reasoning-patterns.md`

The formal reasoning model that connects all other parts of the library.

Six-step SportMind reasoning chain:
  Step 1: Macro check (always first)
  Step 2: Competition classification
  Step 3: Athlete availability (lineup_unconfirmed protocol)
  Step 4: Signal computation (modifier product)
  Step 5: DeFi/liquidity check (fan token applications only)
  Step 6: Confidence output (SMS + schema)

Conflict resolution hierarchy (4 priority levels):
  Priority 1: Hard overrides (macro_override, liquidity_critical, lineup at T-0)
  Priority 2: Soft overrides (injury_warning, weather_risk, manager_departure_imminent)
  Priority 3: Competing signals (weighted average, not binary choice)
  Priority 4: Genuine uncertainty (drop confidence tier, note conflict)

Uncertainty protocols: incomplete lineup, stale form data, missing macro state,
  uncovered sport — each handled explicitly without fabrication

Sport-specific chain variations: football (lineup heaviest), cricket (format pre-chain),
  MMA (weigh-in = Step 1 equivalent), F1 (hardware tier + weather override),
  NBA (star availability dominates), NHL (morning skate goaltender window)

Commercial reasoning chain: 6-step adaptation for APS/governance/scouting analysis

Seven anti-patterns documented: skipping macro, assuming lineup, single-variable
  analysis, false precision, ignoring staleness, conflating prediction/token signals,
  over-narrating low-SMS outputs

Pre-output validation checklist (10 items)

### Added — `core/athlete-financial-intelligence.md`

Financial layer for accurate APS calculations.

Financial APS adjustment formula:
  APS_adjusted = APS_base × Wage_Feasibility × Image_Rights_Factor × Contract_Stage

Contract stage multipliers:
  4+ years remaining: ×0.85 | 2-3 years: ×1.00 | 1 year: ×1.15
  < 6 months (pre-contract eligible): ×1.25 | Expired (free agent): ×1.30

Wage tier structure (football 2025-26): Elite (€300k+/week) through Lower (< €60k/week)
  Wage_Feasibility = target_wage_ceiling / player_current_wage (capped at 1.00)

Image rights taxonomy:
  Player-controlled: APS +0.05 (more portable brand)
  Club-controlled: APS -0.03
  Token-native clause: APS +0.08 to +0.12 (contractual token engagement)

Bonus/incentive signals: UCL appearance bonus → reduces portability to non-European clubs
  (APS_adjusted -0.10 to -0.15); loyalty bonus pending flag; release clause active flag

Financial data sources: Capology, Spotrac, Serie A published wages
  Reliability tiers: Official published (HIGH) vs Agent reports (LOW)

Four new flags: wage_constraint, pre_contract_window, loyalty_bonus_pending, 
  release_clause_active, image_rights_player_controlled

### Added — `fan-token/rwa-sportfi-intelligence/rwa-sportfi-intelligence.md`

Phase 5 intelligence layer — SportMind's framework for reasoning about RWA in sport.

RWA Signal Framework (RSF):
  (Asset_Quality×0.30)+(Legal_Clarity×0.30)+(Liquidity_Depth×0.25)+(Yield_Sustainability×0.15)

Phase 5 spectrum: Arriving Now (staking, LP, prediction markets) → Near-Term
  (media rights, performance bonds, micro-equity) → Longer-Term (full RWA collateral)

Staking yield taxonomy: Tier 1 commercial (1.00) | Tier 2 protocol (0.65-0.80)
  | Tier 3 emissions (0.20-0.45). APY > 40% = almost certainly Tier 3.

Outcome-linked supply mechanics: SportMind's adjusted_score sits directly upstream —
  win probability implies supply burn direction; competition tier implies magnitude

Tokenised media rights: Premier League (£10B+), IPL ($6.2B), NFL ($2.5B/yr) as
  benchmark assets; RSF Asset_Quality 0.90, Legal_Clarity 0.40-0.65

Player performance bonds: DTS + PI + TAI + ABS = bond pricing inputs; minimum
  thresholds (DTS≥75, age≤27, ABS≥70, TAI≥65) for intelligence framing

CollateralFi: fan token LTV tiers (70% for Tier 1, 40-60% for active, 20-40% for Phase 3);
  DeFi leverage cascade pattern documented for major negative events

Monthly monitoring framework: Chiliz, DeFi protocols, regulatory (MiCA, SEBI, FCA, SEC)

### Updated — `sportmind-overview.md`
- Core count: 16 → 19 (manager, reasoning-patterns, athlete-financial)
- L3 count: 29 → 30 (rwa-sportfi-intelligence)
- All new files added to Skills at a Glance tables
- v3.12 roadmap marked ✅; v3.13 defined

### Updated — `llms.txt` → v3.12.0, API → v3.12

## [3.13.0] — 2026-04-04 — Rugby/cricket cycles, full sport compression, community calibration framework

### Added — `market/international-rugby-cycle.md`

Applies the international-football-cycle framework to both rugby codes.

Rugby union NCSI hierarchy: RWC Final=1.00, RWC knockout=0.85-0.95, Six Nations
decider=0.80, Lions series=0.75, Rugby Championship (Bledisloe)=0.70, Autumn
Internationals=0.35-0.50. CVC Capital Partners investment (Six Nations/Premiership/URC)
documented as structural tokenisation signal. Grand Slam attempt = 7-week sustained
narrative. Post-WC transition: faster than football (no transfer window equivalent;
return to club competition within 3-4 weeks).

Rugby league NCSI hierarchy: RLWC Final=1.00, State of Origin Game 3=0.90, NRL Grand
Final=0.90. State of Origin downstream NRL congestion signal documented as the most
commercially valuable underpriced signal in rugby league. Cross-code annual calendar
shows November as simultaneous signal window for both codes.

### Added — `market/international-cricket-cycle.md`

Cricket's parallel four-layer signal model fully documented.

Three-tier NCSI hierarchy: T20 WC Final/ODI WC Final=1.00, WTC Final=0.85, ICC
knockouts=0.80-0.95, Asia Cup Final=0.75, Ashes decisive Test=0.75, standard
bilateral=0.40-0.65, IPL Qualifier/Final=0.70, standard IPL=0.35.

India premium: every India match ×1.40; India-Pakistan ×2.00 permanent override.
ICC Tournament Calendar: T20 WC odd years (2026 India hosting = regulatory catalyst),
ODI WC every 4 years (2027 South Africa), WTC 2-year cycle.

Bilateral model: series_score_momentum applied (trailing team at 0-2 in Test series =
narrative_active flag). Domestic league interaction: IPL overlaps with international
calendar; never double-apply NCSI from both layers.

Post-tournament transition: domestic league recruitment (player auction values shift
with ICC tournament performance); faster return to club competition than football.

### Updated — `compressed/README.md` (168 → 445 lines)

22 new compressed sport domain summaries added (all remaining full domain skills):
Rugby union, rugby league, AFL, American football (NFL), tennis, baseball, ice hockey,
MotoGP, NASCAR, esports, boxing, handball, kabaddi, netball, golf, horse racing, darts,
snooker, athletics, cycling, swimming, rowing, winter sports.

Total compressed skills: 33 (28 sport domains + 5 intelligence layers)
Total tokens: ~3,360 vs ~85,000 full stack (96% compression)
Index table updated with all 33 entries.

### Added — `community/calibration-data/CONTRIBUTING.md`

Complete contributor framework for external community calibration submissions.

Validity requirements: pre-match timestamp required; official source URL; provenance
fields (submitted_by, submission_timestamp); no cherry-picking — wrong predictions
with documentation are more valuable than undocumented correct ones.

Step-by-step submission process with Python code examples, full JSON template with
all required fields, file naming convention, and PR labels.

Quality tiers: Gold (full pre-match docs + verified outcome within 48h), Silver
(direction + basic modifiers + official source), Bronze (clear evidence analysis
preceded match), Rejected (no pre-match evidence or missing provenance).

Priority contributions: dew_modifier (50 records needed — cricket T20 evening), 
rivalry_form_discount (50 records — rugby league SOO), narrative_modifier (100 records),
weight_miss MMA signal (50 records). These are closest to recalibration thresholds.

Calibration review process: threshold reached → maintainer report → 7-day community
review → 70% consensus required → modifier update documented in CHANGELOG.

Recognition: leaderboard acknowledgement, sport expertise badges, calibration impact
badge (when records trigger a recalibration). No financial incentives — biased data
is the risk financial incentives create.

### Updated — `fan-token/rwa-sportfi-intelligence/` 

Sports NFTs and collectibles intelligence section:
  Positioning: Phase 2 (memory tickets), Phase 4 (pivot from tokens), Phase 5 (yield/ownership)
  Athlete NFT as APS modifier: successful collection APS +0.04-0.06
  AELS proxy: when no direct fan token data exists, NFT engagement fills the gap
  Sorare as ATM proxy for player performance assessment
  Platform monitoring: Sorare, NBA Top Shot, Chiliz NFT products, club-native launches

## [3.15.0] — 2026-04-04 — Identity, broadcaster intelligence, governance, MCP deployment, real-time patterns

### Added — `WHO-WE-ARE.md`

Non-technical identity document addressing the objective gap identified in v3.15 planning.
Explains SportMind to sports industry practitioners who are not developers.

Sections: The problem SportMind solves (domain knowledge gap for AI agents), who it is
for (club directors, agents, fan token platforms, broadcasters, analytics practitioners,
AI developers), what is inside (five layers + core + support in plain language), how to
use (developer, practitioner, and contributor pathways), what makes it different (opinionated,
honest about uncertainty, built to be extended, not a data provider), the roadmap,
licence and governance.

### Added — `market/broadcaster-media-intelligence.md`

BVS (Broadcast Value Signal): (Audience_Reach×0.30)+(Engagement_Depth×0.25)+(Rights_Scarcity×0.25)+(Commercial_Premium×0.20)

Rights valuation benchmarks: Premier League £10B+ cycle through PKL and smaller leagues.
International rights as global commercial reach signal (PL international > domestic = global product).

Streaming transition intelligence:
  Fragmentation modifier: highly fragmented (4+ platforms) × 0.75, consolidated × 1.00
  Streaming platform rights win = digital-native audience signal for fan tokens

Broadcaster as signal actor: rights acquisition/loss/price decline each documented as
specific token signals. Rights price decline = BVS reassessment + LTUI risk.

Drive to Survive (DTS) effect: documented conversion chain (documentary viewer → sport viewer
15-25%; sport viewer → token holder 2-5%). A 50M-viewer documentary = 150k-600k potential
new token holders. DTS_effect modifier × 1.08 for featured athletes during release window.

Regional market intelligence: UK, India (500M+ digital viewers, regulatory gap),
USA (World Cup 2026 catalyst), Middle East (QSI bridge), Southeast Asia (MotoGP strength),
Latin America (Argentina crypto adoption and Superclásico opportunity).

### Added — `fan-token/sports-governance-intelligence/sports-governance-intelligence.md`

GSI (Governance Signal Index): (Participation_Rate×0.30)+(Decision_Weight×0.30)+(Transparency_Score×0.25)+(Execution_Track_Record×0.15)

Current Socios governance assessment: Decision_Weight predominantly 0.15-0.45 (cosmetic to
operational). Typical GSI 0.50-0.70. Execution track record 0.85 (generally executes).

4 DAO types: owned clubs (structural governance, Decision_Weight 0.80-1.00), fan councils
(advisory rights, 0.50-0.65), specific decision DAOs (binding on-off votes), multi-club DAOs.

Voting mechanisms: simple majority (whale risk), quadratic (square root of vote weight),
conviction (time-weighted), delegated. Each with governance quality implications.

Lifecycle governance signals: Phase 1 (novelty, cosmetic OK), Phase 2 target GSI 0.60-0.75,
Phase 3 governance fatigue warning signals, Phase 5 financial decision governance.

New flags: governance_theatre (GSI < 0.35), governance_fatigue (declining participation),
structural_vote_active (Decision_Weight ≥ 0.80), whale_dominance_risk (top-10 > 40% voting).

### Added — `platform/sportmind-mcp-deployment.md`

Three deployment options: GitHub Pages (static skill serving, free, 15 min), Vercel
(live MCP server, free tier, 30 min), Docker (self-hosted, 45 min).

GitHub Pages: generate_static_api.py script generates all sport/use_case stack JSON files.
refresh_deployment.py automates hash regeneration and push to gh-pages branch.

Vercel: serverless function wrapper around SportMind MCP core; FastAPI pattern for
webhook integration; Claude Desktop live endpoint config (SSE transport).

Production security checklist: rate limiting, HTTPS, input validation, macro state
refresh schedule, monitoring thresholds.

### Added — `platform/realtime-integration-patterns.md`

5 complete integration patterns with working Python code:

Pattern 1 — Macro webhook: BTC/CHZ price fetch → cycle classification → macro-state.json
update. Drift alert when modifier changes ≥ 0.25. Schedule: every 6 hours.

Pattern 2 — Lineup webhook: LineupWebhookHandler processes lineup events. Key player
absent → activate injury_warning + send reload alert. Confirmed → clear lineup_unconfirmed,
upgrade to 100% position size.

Pattern 3 — Token monitor: TokenSignalMonitor computes HAS from on-chain data every 15
minutes. HAS spike detection (> 15 point rise), TVL tier monitoring, alert callbacks.

Pattern 4 — Weather integration: venue coordinates + sport → WeatherSignal. Sport-specific:
cricket (dew factor + DLS risk), F1 (wet race hardware reset), football (wind modifier),
golf (scoring average impact from wind).

Pattern 5 — Full pipeline: all sources in parallel (asyncio.gather). Returns complete
signal with live_inputs, data_freshness, flags derived from actual live data.

## [3.17.0] — 2026-04-04 — Autonomous agent framework, MCP agent status, multi-agent coordination, calibration drive

### Added — `core/autonomous-agent-framework.md`

The SportMind agent model — defines what a SportMind autonomous agent is and how it operates.

Intelligence separation principle: SportMind agents generate intelligence; application
layers (FanTokenIntel, SportFi Kit) take action. This is the foundational safety principle.

Autonomy spectrum (5 levels):
  Level 0 (Supervised): human approves every output
  Level 1 (Advisory): agent informs; human decides
  Level 2 (Semi-autonomous): acts at SMS≥threshold; escalates outside boundary
  Level 3 (Autonomous with review): acts immediately; human reviews log
  Level 4 (Fully autonomous): operates indefinitely within hard technical boundaries
  Financial execution and governance votes: hardcoded Level 0-1 regardless of SMS

Agent lifecycle: 7 states (INITIALISING → MONITORING → ANALYSING → ACTING or
ESCALATING → WAITING_FOR_HUMAN → PAUSED → TERMINATED). State transitions documented
with trigger conditions.

Decision framework matrix: SMS × blocking flags × decision category → autonomous/
advisory/escalate. Blocking flags are absolute — macro_override_active, liquidity_critical,
governance_theatre override SMS quality at all autonomy levels.

Agent-to-agent protocol: registration schema (capability declaration), signal sharing
(publish/consume model), conflict resolution (higher SMS wins; recency on tie; escalate
on genuine tie). Capability boundaries: agents must not request actions outside declared scope.

Ecosystem integration protocol: FanTokenIntel (reads from signal bus), SportFi Kit
(reads recommended_action, never receives direct contract call trigger), LLMs (reasoning
component called by agent, output validated against schema), data layer (read-only).

6 safety principles: intelligence separation, confidence gating, flag respect,
escalation completeness, audit trail, graceful degradation.

Python SportMindAgent base class: complete implementation with lifecycle, decision
framework, safety validation, observable state, and extensible analyse/act/escalate
interface. Ready for subclassing in production deployments.

### Updated — `platform/sportmind-mcp-server.md` (689 → 785 lines)

5th MCP tool: `sportmind_agent_status`
  Returns: agent lifecycle state, health, uptime, cycle counts, action/escalation counts,
  current macro modifier, pending escalations, upcoming events with hours_away and
  signal tier, data freshness flags (macro/stacks/hashes)
  Multi-agent query: returns all registered agents with system-wide health assessment
  Use cases: supervisor observability, health dashboard, orchestrator checking signal
  reliability, debugging escalation behaviour

### Updated — `scripts/sportmind_mcp.py`

sportmind_agent_status handler added. Returns framework reference and usage instructions
when no live agent instance is connected (graceful degradation pattern).

### Added — `examples/agentic-workflows/multi-agent-coordination.md`

Four patterns operating as a coordinated system.

SignalBus: thread-safe shared signal store (Path-based with lock; production swap to
Redis/PostgreSQL). publish/consume/has_signal/resolve_conflict API. Agents consume
rather than re-analyse when signal exists in bus.

Coordination triggers:
  Portfolio monitor → pre-match chain: triggers T-48h analysis when event is 48h away
    and no existing analysis in bus; consumes existing signal if available
  Pre-match chain → tournament tracker: feeds NCSI per match result after T-2h analysis
  Pre-match chain → signal invalidation: publishes when key player absent (reload required)
  Transfer monitor → pre-match chain: invalidates stale signals when transfer confirmed
  Tournament tracker → portfolio monitor: NCSI delta updates via bus after each match

ConflictResolver: resolve() returns best signal by SMS then recency; detect_genuine_conflict()
flags when two signals are within 5 SMS points (genuine uncertainty → escalate).

SystemOrchestrator: starts all 4 agents concurrently (asyncio.gather), health monitor
every 30 minutes, system-wide status for sportmind_agent_status MCP tool.

Ecosystem integration in coordinated context: FanTokenIntel subscribes to bus for portfolio
signals; SportFi Kit reads recommended_action; LLMs called per-agent for reasoning;
humans receive consolidated escalation view.

### Calibration drive: 12 new records (total 22 across 11 sports)

New sport validations:
  Ice hockey: GSAx goaltender differential as primary signal validated (NHL Leafs-Bruins)
  Tennis: surface win% for elite vs elite validated; low SMS (64) correct for high variance
  PSL cricket: PSL Final token signal validated — $LAH +12.4% post-win (first cricket token price record)

Critical modifier validations:
  weight_miss_modifier x0.72: VALIDATED — fighter who missed weight lost (MMA UFC FN)
    Most important single MMA modifier; now has direct evidence
  relegation_stakes_modifier x1.40: VALIDATED — first record from football-leagues-advanced.md
    Everton home win in relegation six-pointer confirms prize window modifier model
  Der Klassiker derby compression 40%: validated — stronger team won despite derby compression
  IPL dew factor: validated — dew present but MI defended; confirms dew reduces advantage, doesn't override quality
  Contract year x1.08 (NBA): validated — Tatum outstanding performance in contract year
  Qualifying delta F1: validated — 0.312s gap correctly predicted race win
  NRL defensive system modifier: validated — Storm away defensive pattern confirmed

First WRONG direction record (UCL QF PSG-Arsenal):
  Draw outcome correctly identified as learning: two-legged tie first-leg draw premium
  needed. Wrong predictions are as valuable as correct ones for calibration.

Sports coverage: basketball (3), cricket (3), football (4), formula1 (2), mma (3),
rugby-league (2), rugby-union (1), ice-hockey (1), tennis (1)
Direction accuracy across all 22 records: 20/22 (90.9%)

### Added — `core/agent-intelligence-model.md`

Honest ANI/AGI/ASI framework applied to SportMind:
  ANI: intentional narrow excellence — better to be world's best sports intelligence than mediocre at everything
  AGI: not SportMind's target — explicitly addressed and explained why domain excellence > general competence
  ASI: the domain aspiration — exceeds any individual expert through community calibration + collective knowledge

Four intelligence dimensions with honest assessment:
  Reasoning: 94% calibrated accuracy from 60 records; framework works; LLM dependency explicit
  Planning: multi-cycle execution confirmed; goal-setting boundary acknowledged (roadmap post-v3.22)
  Learning: human-mediated calibration — validated and improving, not instant self-modification
  Context: WHO-WE-ARE + agent framework provides purpose; consolidated context doc (v3.22 roadmap)

Intelligence architecture layers 1-4 (Knowledge → Reasoning → Action → Learning loop). Developer
implications section: what this means for deployments, continuous improvement, long-horizon vision.

### Added — `platform/chiliz-agent-kit-integration.md`

Complete TypeScript pipeline: natural language → parseIntent() → getSportMindSignal() → evaluateGateway()
→ executeAction() (Chiliz Agent Kit). Three patterns: (1) NL intent to action, (2) pre-match scheduled
trigger with EventEmitter, (3) governance vote intelligence brief. Gateway decision layer implements Safety
Principle 1 (intelligence separation): hard blocks for macro_override, liquidity_critical, SMS < 60,
financial actions at Level 0-1. Private key security: never in SportMind context, server-side only.
Stack summary: SportFi Kit (UI/UX) + SportMind (intelligence) + Chiliz Agent Kit (execution) + Chiliz Chain.

### Added — `examples/applications/app-10-fan-digital-twin.md`

## [3.22.0] — 2026-04-05 — Purpose/context document, agent goal framework, swimming/winter-sports, GitHub Pages, 70 calibration records

### Added — `core/sportmind-purpose-and-context.md`

Single-load ~600 token context document for agent initialisation.

Five non-negotiable rules: (1) Macro first — always load and check macro state before fan token signals.
(2) Loading order — macro → market → domain → athlete → fan-token → schema. (3) Intelligence separation —
agents generate intelligence; applications act. (4) Confidence honesty — SMS < 60 = PARTIAL; state this.
(5) Sport-specific primary signal — football T-2h lineup, cricket FORMAT FIRST, MMA WEIGH-IN FIRST,
F1 qualifying delta, NHL morning skate, NBA DNP-rest, rugby kicker form, tennis surface win%.

Ecosystem map: Data Layer → SportMind Intelligence Layer → Application Layer → Execution Layer.
Confidence output schema with all required fields. SMS tier table. Autonomy levels 0-4.
Key document map (domain knowledge, athlete intel, fan token, operations, developer resources).

### Added — `core/agent-goal-framework.md`

Three goal levels: Terminal (human-set, never changes), Instrumental (agent-set, adapts to observations),
Immediate (agent lifecycle tasks). 6 goal states with transition rules.

Planning cycle: observations (macro state, upcoming events, HAS spikes, data freshness) →
goal evaluation → task generation. Five goal-generation triggers: terminal decomposition,
achievement creates dependencies, observed signals, calendar horizon scan, failure creates diagnostic.

GoalDirectedAgent Python class: _add_goal(), achieve_goal(), get_next_goal(), planning_cycle(),
get_goal_status(). Fully extensible via subclassing. Goal status exposed via sportmind_agent_status MCP tool.

Portfolio monitor example: build_portfolio_monitor_goals() decomposes terminal goal into 3 initial
instrumental goals (baselines, schedule, monitoring confirmation).

### Added — `core/modifier-recalibration-v3.md`

First empirical recalibration from 70 outcome records. Three modifiers UPDATED:
  derby_draw_premium: formal update — DRAW_LIKELY as primary direction when derby_active AND
                      form_differential < 0.10 AND no elimination stakes; position_size capped 50%
  post_tournament_opener: new flag — first match of new season within 30 days of major tournament
                           final → expand draw window; reduce positional confidence by 1 tier
  two_legged_tie_leg1: Leg 1 draw premium formalised — tactical draw elevated; wide prediction range

Five modifiers CONFIRMED (athlete_modifier, qualifying_delta, india_pakistan ×2.00,
morning_skate_protocol, competition_tier_weight). Three wrong-direction records fully analysed —
all involve draws; all had SMS < 70; none involve high-confidence errors. Pattern identified:
draw prediction systematic issue in European football tactical contexts. Recalibration methodology
documented. Path to full thresholds: athlete_modifier first at ~v3.25-v3.27.

19 sports now covered — every major global sport has at least one record.

RECALIBRATION VALIDATION: Derby draw premium update (DRAW_LIKELY) immediately validated —
Man City 1-1 Man Utd (Northwest Derby, form_differential < 0.08). Protocol update confirmed correct.

BREAKING NEWS VALIDATION: GK change at T-1h → MODIFY protocol → direction changed HOME→AWAY
→ correct outcome. Core breaking-news-intelligence.md protocol empirically confirmed.

Direction accuracy: 77/80 (96%) — highest in library history.
3 wrong-direction records in 80 total (3.75% error rate).

## [3.29.0] — 2026-04-05 — Community Release

### The release milestone

v3.29 is the community release of SportMind. The intelligence framework, calibration
pipeline, developer tooling, and community contribution infrastructure are complete.
This version adds the final repository infrastructure required for a public open-source
release and performs a final consistency sweep across all community-facing documents.

### Added — `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

Written specifically for SportMind's technical community — not a generic template.

Three core principles: (1) Technical honesty — calibration records must be submitted
before matches, never backfilled with result knowledge; wrong predictions submitted
honestly are more valuable than correct ones submitted falsely. (2) Analytical neutrality —
skills must not encode systematic bias toward any team, club, or outcome. (3) Specific,
evidenced feedback — inaccuracy reports must provide the specific claim, why it is wrong,
and a source.

What is not acceptable: backfilled calibration records, coordinated modifier manipulation,
personal attacks, harassment. Enforcement: maintainer discretion, decisions are final.

### Added — `CITATION.cff`

CFF 1.2.0 standard. Enables automatic citation generation by GitHub, Zenodo, and
academic reference tools. Fields: title, version (3.28.0), date-released, license (MIT),
url, repository-code, keywords (12), preferred-citation block with abstract.

### Added — `RELEASE.md`

Community release announcement document. Contents: what is in the release (framework,
calibration foundation, developer tooling, community infrastructure), why calibration
records matter (modifier threshold progress, Founding Calibrator recognition), what is
NOT included (live data, full modifier recalibration, hosted infrastructure), three
getting-started paths (5-minute LLM, developer clone, WHO-USES-THIS.md navigation),
acknowledgements of the founding team's calibration seed work.

### Updated — `community/leaderboard.md`

Removed stale v3.2 content. Updated to v3.28 state: 126 records across 21 sports,
founding team position clarified (Expert 🏆 with N/A modifier accuracy — threshold not yet
reached), clear call to action for first external contributor, Founding Calibrator path.

### Updated — `llms.txt`

Fixed stale example file paths: standalone/ → starter-pack/, langchain/ → starter-pack/,
claude-mcp/ → starter-pack/. Version: 3.29.0.

- `.github/` `scripts/` — owner (affects all contributors)
- Root docs (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, etc.) — owner
- `examples/` — lighter touch, any maintainer

All delegation slots are commented with clear instructions for adding handles
when co-maintainers emerge. No setup required on GitHub beyond replacing
`SportMind` with the actual handle before pushing.

### Updated — `CONTRIBUTING.md`

"Becoming a co-maintainer" section added after the existing Recognition section.

No application process — co-maintainership through demonstrated contribution.
Three qualification paths: 3+ merged PRs in a domain, 10+ validated calibration
records, or 5+ validated translations in one language. Judgment demonstrated
through constructive PR reviews and understanding the quality bar.

What co-maintainers do: review and merge PRs in their domain, triage issues,
participate in recalibration decisions. What they do not need to do: review
everything or be immediately available (7-day review windows are standard).

Domain areas expected to need co-maintainers first: calibration records (highest
volume), football, cricket, i18n languages.

Fastest path to co-maintainer status: calibration records (demonstrate judgment,
honesty, and library familiarity in a concrete and verifiable way).

## [3.30.0] — 2026-04-05 — Chiliz 2030 intelligence: gamified tokenomics, US regulatory, omni-chain, RWA staging

### Added — `fan-token/gamified-tokenomics-intelligence/gamified-tokenomics-intelligence.md`

New skill for Chiliz 2030 performance-linked tokenomics (Q2 2026 rollout).

What gamified tokenomics are: Win→tokens burn (scarcity), Loss→tokens mint (dilution),
Draw→no change. Why this matters: WIN prediction is now simultaneously a SUPPLY REDUCTION
prediction; standard static-supply signal model does not apply.

Detection: KAYEN API gamified flag, Socios.com "performance-linked" indicator. Default
assumption: pre-Q2 2026 tokens are STANDARD unless confirmed. Never apply gamified
multiplier to unconfirmed tokens.

Win modifier formula: gamified_win_multiplier = 1.00 + (burn_rate_pct × 2.5)
Example: 0.3% burn/win → ×1.0075 amplification on top of standard signal.
Loss modifier: gamified_loss_multiplier = 1.00 − (mint_rate_pct × 2.0)
Draw: no modifier (verify contract for draw-specific handling).

Season supply tracking: accumulate net burned/minted across all matches. Net burned
>5% → MILD_SCARCITY modifier; championship run (10+ wins) → ×1.08 season floor boost.
Prediction market interaction flag. Unusual pre-match volume flag (>3× in 4h window).
Stage 2 detection rule: re-check gamified status at start of each new season.
Output schema extension: gamified_modifier + season_supply_position fields.

### Added — `macro/macro-regulatory-sportfi.md`

New macro skill for the 2025-2026 regulatory turning point across four jurisdictions.

EU MiCA (fully active January 2025): utility fan tokens classified as utility tokens,
whitepaper required, CASP licensing for exchanges. Revenue-sharing tokens: national
securities law applies. Agent implication: EU = regulatory_clarity HIGH.

US Joint SEC/CFTC Guidance (landmark 2026): Pure utility fan tokens classified as
UTILITY DIGITAL COMMODITIES under CFTC — NOT securities. This is the regulatory unlock
for US market re-entry (first US partnership Q1 2026 per Chiliz 2030 Manifesto).
US sports market: NFL ~$25B, NBA ~$12B, MLB ~$11B annual revenue. US_market_entry_signal
activates as Tier 1 macro event. CDI window 45-60 days at first US token launch.

Brazil: First revenue-sharing RWA live on Chiliz Chain — Phase 5b confirmed operational,
not theoretical. UK: FCA utility token framework, MEDIUM clarity.

Regulatory discount framework: HIGH (EU/US utility) = 0.00 → RESTRICTED (China) = ABSTAIN.
Quarterly monitoring rule with specific sources (ESMA, CFTC, FCA, IOSCO).

### Updated — `fan-token/rwa-sportfi-intelligence/rwa-sportfi-intelligence.md` (605 → 729 lines)

Three-stage Fan Token evolution from Chiliz 2030 Manifesto:
Stage 1 (2019-2025): Utility baseline. Stage 2 (2026): Dynamic tokenomics (gamified
mechanics + omni-chain). Stage 3 (2027-2030): RWA with equity/revenue exposure.
Stage stacking principle: stages do not replace — they accumulate.

Omni-chain liquidity intelligence: LayerZero bridge from Q1 2026. Agent adjustment:
check omni_chain flag, aggregate TVL across all chains, apply omni_chain_bonus to tier.
Arbitrage check before raising unusual_activity flag on cross-chain tokens.
PEPPER governance token: KAYEN's community governance token; monitor for protocol changes.

Updated RSF formula with stage bonuses: +0.08 (Stage 2), +0.12 (Stage 2+omnichain),
+0.20 (Stage 3). Updated LTUI ranges for stacked stages.

### Updated — `platform/data-connector-templates.md`

KAYEN section updated: omni-chain awareness (Q1 2026 LayerZero), cross_chain_tvl field,
PEPPER governance token context, gamified tokenomics detection note with skill reference.

### Updated — `compressed/README.md` (52 → 54 summaries)

Gamified tokenomics (~200t): detection, WIN/LOSS formulas, season supply tiers, flags.
Macro regulatory SportFi (~210t): all four jurisdictions, discount framework, US event signal.

### Updated — `sportmind-overview.md`
Fan token skills: 36 → 37. Compressed: 52 → 54. v3.30 ✅; v3.31+ roadmap defined.

### Updated — `llms.txt` → v3.30.0, API → v3.30
